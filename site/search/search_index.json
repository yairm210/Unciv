Some of our will be obvious to you, some will not. Use Kotlin Unciv started its life as a Unity project in C#, was shifted to Java and LibGDX, and finally to Kotlin. I regret every minute that I spent writing events in Java, this is probably the most significant change that your application could see. Use Scene2d Unless you plan on creating images on the fly, you'll probably be using prerendered assets. Placing them manually is akin to manually positioning html tags, instead of using html heirarchy and css to guide positions. So too is Scene2d - as a placement framework. it's relatively simple to understand, especially when you... Ignore Horizontal and Vertical groups - use Table I personally found that table has all the functionality of the above, and more. Each class has a different syntax too, so I found it much simpler to just stick with Table for everything. Table does just about EVERYTHING! It's insanely amazing! If your game is getting slow, use the Android profiler in Android Studio The top-down CPU chart is the best code profiler I've ever seen, use it to your advantage! Cache everything Caching is a trade-off between purer, state-agnostic code and higher performance. Coming from a PC background, I automatically assume that anything less than O(n^2) is less than a milisecond and therefore, not a cachinhg candidate. This is not so in mobile development. This becomes especially relevant when you need to save and load game data which has lots of connected parts - you have to avoid circular references, and you want to minimise the save size, but you need to reconstruct the missing links when loading. Minimize String operations All the tip and tricks you've heard to minimize String operations? Use them! String constants should be consts, use StringBuilders (or just ArrayLists of strings that you later .joinToString()) Sequences everywhere! One thing I did not expect to be such an issue is intermediate lists when sorting and mapping. But apparently, the memory allocation for these tasks is Serious Business. So whenever possible, take your list and .asSequence() it before actiating list operations - this results in huge savings of both time and memory! The only time you shouldn't be doing this, though, is when you want to cache the specific values for future use - sequences will go through the whole process every time you iterate on them, so just .toList() them when you've gotten the final results! General tips for making an Open Source game Lower the entry bar - for both programmers and players I think that most Open Source games suffer from this problem - those that are in are way in, but those that are out and want to join have to learn the ecosystem. Documentation is a big issue here, but so are detailed instructions - and I mean \"Spoonfeeding\". Treat new developers as if they've never used Git before - it's possible they haven't! Explain how to dowload the sourecode, the tools, how to get the game running locally, how to make changes and how to submit them. Same think with new players - getting the game up and running should be AS SIMPLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE - you want people to play your game, don't you? This includes: Source-To-Executable automation - I use Travis Play stores and the like Internal game tutorials - your players will NEVER BE SATISFIED with this last point, but at least do what you candidate Community, Community, Community! I, personally, underestimated this point for about a year after launch. I communicated with players through the Google Play Store and Github issues, and that seemed to be enough. It was only after repeated urgings from players that I opened a Discord server - and that gradually lead to a massive change! You see, it's not ABOUT programmer-to-player interaction. There will always be a small number of core devs relative to the large playerbase. The key to the community is the player-to-player interaction. Explaining things, questions, ideas, things that players bounc off each other, not only make the amorphous community a better pllace, but actually lead to a better game! Another think to remember is that there's a larger community around you - the Open Source community, the Linux community, etc. There are lots of people who will play your game only because it's open source, and it also means they don't have as many options. For example... Being the best 4X game means competing with the biggest names out there Being the best 4X game for Linux means many less competitors, but All The Cool Kids (tm) are multiplatforming nowadays so you're still outperformed. Being the best Open Source 4X game means about 5 competitors, and no money is involved either so the average entry is not as polished. Being the best Open Source 4X game for Android... means having so few competitors that it's totally doable. Everything is marketing. Your game's name, the icon, screenshots, everythig a player sees about your game is marketing. Icons and bylines are especially important, since they're the first things your players will probably see. I saw an almost 50% (!) by changing the icon, after seveeral experiments, which Google Play lets you conduct very easily. Translations are part of your source code This may be slightly contraversial, so I'll explain. We went though a number of iterations regarding how to save translations until we arrived at the current format. The important parts are: Game translation files should be AUTO GENERATED. This allows you to add new objects into the game with impunity, knowing that corresponding lines will be auto-added to the translations. Translations for each language should be stored separately - this allows concurrent modification of several independant languages with no risk of conflict Translations should be PR'd in! This allows other speakers to question or change the proposed translations, and allows you to run tests on your translations. If you require a specific format, this is invaluable as it means that bad translations will be rejected at the door. Open source problems require open (source?) solutions TL;DR, consider using APIs that are free, even if they're not Open Source. Multiplayer requires syncing game files beween clients, even when one of them is not currently online. The 'correct' way to solve this would probably be to have an online DB and a service which handles user requests. Since this is an Open Source game, I'm working on a 0$ budget, so we just store all the files in Dropbox and upload/download there. Is this secure? No, but does it need to be? You need to think of the cost vs the value. Same thing with Mods. Steam is big and secure so it handles its mods itself. We are small and open, so we just allow to download from Github, which lets us use all of Github's built in functions (user management, readmes, stars, versioning...) at no extra cost. And unlike the Dropbox usage, which is basically abuse, Github is built for thiss kind of thing! This is exactly the kind of use case they were thinking of to start with! The Reckoning There comes a time in every project where the cool stuff is done. All the cutting-edge awesomeness and algorithmic playdough is done, and now all (hah) it needs is polish. You know who loves polish? Players! Sure, there are some that say \"a good game is good even if it's basic\" but they have standards for what a basic game should have as well. And the numbers don't lie. Polished games sell themselves better, and so are played more. You know who doesn't love polish? DEVELOPERS. When your game is relatively simple, then the options for polish are more limited, but the more complex the game, the more polish-venues there are. And it can be an ABSOLUTE GRIND. Another weird use-case, another ingame option, \"better performance\" (I must have spent dozens of hours on different performance related actions) And the worst thing is, that everyone notices when it's missing, but no one notices when it's there. A hundred versions of polish - literally - and the average player may notice only a slight change. And then comes the moment when you ask yourself, why bother? What are we even doing here? For me, the answers are as follows: A. To build something truly great, you have to keep going way beyond when it stops being fun. B. There's a community of people that like what you're doing and want there to be more of it :) C. You know you want to keep coding, and what, you think you're going to start another project and it'll work out as well? You've tried that multiple times, and let's face it the chance of you making a second game that goes so well is really small unless you invest in it as much time as you have in this, and yeah, then you'll be back in this position again. And that's basically the loop I've been in for the last hundred versions or so! Solve bugs, fix edge cases, improve AI, accept PRs. Lots of mod-related changes, both to stop the game breaking when people do things in mods that they shouldn't and to allow them more freedom in making them. I don't think I'll ever really continue to finish G&K, I'm DEFINITELY not planning on implementing BNW mechanics which frankly I think are...not great. That's where I am right now. Kind of done with the game, but considering that I thought that half a year ago and releases are still releasing roughly every week, also kind of not.","title":"Tips and tricks for making a LibGDX game"},{"location":"Game%20Making%20Tips/#tips-and-tricks-for-making-a-libgdx-game","text":"Here are a bunch of things I've learned from by brief excursion into the world of game making.

This allows you to add new objects into the game with impunity, knowing that corresponding lines will be auto-added to the translations. Translations for each language should be stored separately - this allows concurrent modification of several independant languages with no risk of conflict Translations should be PR'd in! This allows other speakers to question or change the proposed translations, and allows you to run tests on your translations. If you require a specific format, this is invaluable as it means that bad translations will be rejected at the door.","title":"Translations are part of your source code"},{"location":"Game%20Making%20Tips/#open-source-problems-require-open-source-solutions","text":"TL;DR, consider using APIs that are free, even if they're not Open Source. Multiplayer requires syncing game files beween clients, even when one of them is not currently online. The 'correct' way to solve this would probably be to have an online DB and a service which handles user requests. Since this is an Open Source game, I'm working on a 0$ budget, so we just store all the files in Dropbox and upload/download there. Is this secure? No, but does it need to be? You need to think of the cost vs the value. Same thing with Mods. Steam is big and secure so it handles its mods itself. We are small and open, so we just allow to download from Github, which lets us use all of Github's built in functions (user management, readmes, stars, versioning...) at no extra cost. And unlike the Dropbox usage, which is basically abuse, Github is built for thiss kind of thing! This is exactly the kind of use case they were thinking of to start with!","title":"Open source problems require open (source?) solutions"},{"location":"Game%20Making%20Tips/#the-reckoning","text":"There comes a time in every project where the cool stuff is done. All the cutting-edge awesomeness and algorithmic playdough is done, and now all (hah) it needs is polish. You know who loves polish? Players! Sure, there are some that say \"a good game is good even if it's basic\" but they have standards for what a basic game should have as well. And the numbers don't lie. Polished games sell themselves better, and so are played more. You know who doesn't love polish? DEVELOPERS. When your game is relatively simple, then the options for polish are more limited, but the more complex the game, the more polish-venues there are. And it can be an ABSOLUTE GRIND. Another weird use-case, another ingame option, \"better performance\" (I must have spent dozens of hours on different performance related actions) And the worst thing is, that everyone notices when it's missing, but no one notices when it's there. A hundred versions of polish - literally - and the average player may notice only a slight change. And then comes the moment when you ask yourself, why bother? What are we even doing here? For me, the answers are as follows: A. To build something truly great, you have to keep going way beyond when it stops being fun. B. There's a community of people that like what you're doing and want there to be more of it :) C. You know you want to keep coding, and what, you think you're going to start another project and it'll work out as well? You've tried that multiple times, and let's face it the chance of you making a second game that goes so well is really small unless you invest in it as much time as you have in this, and yeah, then you'll be back in this position again. And that's basically the loop I've been in for the last hundred versions or so! Solve bugs, fix edge cases, improve AI, accept PRs. Lots of mod-related changes, both to stop the game breaking when people do things in mods that they shouldn't and to allow them more freedom in making them. I don't think I'll ever really continue to finish G&K, I'm DEFINITELY not planning on implementing BNW mechanics which frankly I think are...not great. That's where I am right now.

page Mods can supply additional graphics not included in the base game Mods can override built-in sounds Mods can supply additional music tracks Permanent audiovisual mods The following chapters describe possibilities that will work while a mod is active . It is either selected for the current game (during new game creation, cannot be changed after that for saved games), meaning all its rules and resources will be used. Or it is marked as 'Permanent audiovisual mod' in the mod manager (you must select it in the 'installed' column to get the checkbox). In that case only graphics and audio will be active, the rule changes will be ignored (if it contains any) unless the first way is also used. Override built-in graphics If a mod supplies an image with the same name and path as one included in the base game (and its atlas is up to date), and the mod is active, the mod's graphics will be used instead of the built-in one. For example, if you include a file named \"Images/OtherIcons/Link.png\" in your mod, you will be overriding the little chain links icon denoting linked lines in Civilopedia. Please note, as for adding items, your graphics should keep the size and color choices of the original, or the result may be surprising, e.g. when the game tries to tint such an image. Supply additional graphics Currently there are two kinds where the game has display capability but does not supply graphics itself, as described in the next paragraphs: Adding Wonder Splash Screens You can add wonder images to mods and they'll be displayed instead of the standard icon when a wonder is finished. The image needs to be a .png and 2:1 ratio so for example 200x100 px. Add the images to /Images/WonderImages/ . They need to be named according to the name field in Buildings.json , so for example \"Temple of Artemis.png\" or \"Stonehenge.png\" Remember, to be compatible with mobile devices, a fresh atlas needs to be generated including these. Adding Leader Portraits The base game comes without Leader Portraits, but is able to display them in greetings, Civilopedia, diplomacy screens, or the nation picker. A mod can supply these, by adding their images to /Images/LeaderIcons/ . The file name must correspond exactly with the leader name of a nation as defined in Nations.json, or they will be ignored. These work best if they are square, between 100x100 and 256x256 pixels, and include some transparent border within that area. For example, here is mod showing how to add leader portraits, which can complement the base game. Override built-in sounds This works like graphics, except no atlas is involved. E.g. you include a sounds/Click.mp3, it will play instead of the normal click sound. These files must stay short and small. A sound larger than 1MB when uncompressed may break or not play at all on mobile devices. Unciv tries to standardize on 24kHz sample rate, joint stereo, low-bitrate VBR (-128kbps) mp3. Only mp3 and ogg formats will be recognized (but an existing mp3 can be overridden with an ogg file). Supply additional music Sound files (mp3 or ogg) in a mod /music folder will be recognized and used when the mod is active. Except for context-specific music as described in the following paragraphs, tracks will play randomly from all available tracks (with a little bias to avoid close repetition of tracks). There is no overriding - a \"thatched-villagers.mp3\" in a mod will play in addition to and with the same likelihood as the file that the base game offers to download for you. There is no hard technical limit on bitrate or length, but large bandwidth requirements may lead to stuttering (The end of a \"next turn\", right before the world map is updated, and with very large maps, is the most likely to cause this). Context-sensitive music: Overview The Music Controller will generally play one track after another, with a pause (can be changed in options) between. Leave-game confirmation dialog is opened playback will fade out and pause and can resume when it is closed. There are various 'triggers' in the game code initiating a choice for a new track. The new track will, if necessary, fade out the currently playing track quickly before it starts playing. Track choice involves context provided by the trigger and a random factor, and an attempt is made to not repeat any track until at least eight others have played. Mods can provide their own music folder, and if they are active its contents will be treated exactly the same as those in the main music folder. Mods should control usage of their tracks by careful choice of file name. Mod developers can watch console output for messages logging track choice with trigger parameters or loading errors. One track is special: The Thatched Villagers (see also credits.md). The game is able to download it if the music folder is empty, and it is played when the music volume slider is used. It is also a fallback track should certain problems occur (a broken file, however, will shut down the player until another trigger happens). Context-sensitive music: List of Triggers Triggers indicate context (call it intent, mood, whatever, it doesn't matter) by optionally providing a prefix and/or suffix to match against the file name. There are a few flags as well influencing choice or behaviour - one flag function is to make prefix or suffix mandatory, meaning if no available file matches the track chooser will do nothing. Otherwise, a next track will always be chosen from the available list by sorting and then picking the first entry. Sorting is done by in order of precedence: Prefix match, Suffix match, Recently played, and a random number. Therefore, as currently no triggers have an empty prefix, files matching none of the prefixes will never play unless there are less than eight files matching the requested prefix. The current list of triggers is as follows: Description Prefix M[^M] Suffix M[^X] Flags Automatic next-track[^0] Ambient Launch game[^1] Menu Every 10th turn (player civ name) M Peace or War[^2] F[^F] New game: Select a mod (mod name) M Theme S[^S] New game: Pick a nation for a player (nation name) M Theme or Peace S[^S] Diplomacy: Select player (nation name) M Peace or War[^3] S[^S] First contact[^4] (civ name) M Theme or Peace M War declaration[^5] (civ name) M War M Civ defeated (civ name) Defeat M Golden Age (civ name) M Golden M N[^N] Wonder built (wonder name) M Built M N[^N] Tech researched (tech name) M Researched M N[^N] Map editor: Select nation start location (nation name) M Theme S[^S] N[^N] Options: Volume slider or Default track downloaded D[^D] Options: Click currently playing label[^6] M Ambient S[^S] Legend: [^N]: Not implemented [^M]: Prefix must match.

Let's look at the example \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" to learn how the game decides which images it should use for this tile: When there is a rule variant entry in the tileset config for this tile we will use the entry. Else if there is an image called \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" we will use it instead. Otherwise, we will check if there is an image called \"Grassland+Jungle\" (BaseTerrain+Terrainfeatures) and \"Dyes+Trading post\" (Resource+Improvement) and use the remainings of it. Let's say you made an image called \"Grassland+Jungle\" but none called \"Dyes+Trading post\". In the end, we will then use the images \"Grassland+Jungle\", \"Dyes\" and \"Trading post\". All these images can also use era-dependant variants if you want to change the appearance of, let's say, \"Trading post\" throughout the game. Just create images and add the suffix \"-[era name]\". E.g. \"Trading post-Classical era\", \"Trading post-Industrial era\", etc. It is advised to use the layered approach (1 and 3) often because it comes with a few advantages. Mainly: - Decreased filesize (on disk, for downloads) - Easier support for new terrains, improvements, resources, and for changing existing tiles You should keep in mind that the default rendering order is: BaseTerrain, TerrainFeatures, Resource, Improvement. Tileset config This is where tileset configs shine. You can use these to alter the way Unicv renders tiles. To create a config for your tileset you just need to create a new .json file under Jsons/Tilesets/. Just create a .txt file and rename it to MyCoolTilesetExample.json. You only have to add things if you want to change them. Else the default values will be used. This is an example of such a config file that I will explain below: \"useColorAsBaseTerrain\": \"false\", \"unexploredTileColor\": {\"r\":1,\"g\":1,\"b\":1,\"a\":1}, \"fogOfWarColor\": {\"r\":1,\"g\":0,\"b\":0,\"a\":1}, \"ruleVariants\": { \"Grassland+Forest\": [\"Grassland\",\"ForestForGrassland\"], \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\": [\"Grassland\",\"JungleForGrasslandBack\",\"Dyes+Trading post\",\"JungleForGrasslandFront\"] } useColorAsBaseTerrain A boolean value (\"true\" or \"false\").

Default value: \"{\"r\":0, \"g\":0, \"b\":0, \"a\":1}\" (Black) Defines the color of the fog of war.

You've solved all the bugs and now you just need to get it out to everyone! So, how does THAT work? The process has two major parts, one is \"Getting your code in the main repository\" and the other is \"Deploying versions\" - as a developer, you'll be taking an active part in the first process, but the second process is on me =) Getting your code in the main repo First off, push your changes with Git to your own branch at https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv.git. I hope you've been doing this during development too, but that's none of my business *sips tea* Issue a pull request from https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv - from the Pull Requests is the simplest The Travis build will check that your proposed change builds properly and passes all tests I'll go over your pull request and will ask questions and request changes - this is not only for code quality and standard, it's mostly so you can learn how the repo works for the next change you make =) When everything looks good, I'll merge your code in and it'll enter the next release! Deploying versions When I'm ready to release a new version I: * Comment \"merge translations\" in one of the open PRs tagged as 'mergeable translation' to trigger the translation branch creation, add a \"summary\" comment to trigger summary generation, merge the PR and delete the branch (so next version translation branch starts fresh) * From my workstation - pull the latest changes and run the translation generation * Change the versionCode and versionName in the Android build.gradle so that Google Play and F-droid can recognize that it's a different release * Add an entry in the changelog.md done, WITHOUT hashtags, and less than 500 characters (that's the limit for Google play entries). The formatting needs to be exact or the text sent to Discord, the Github release etc. won't be complete. * Add a tag to the commit of the version. When the Github action sees that we've added a tag, it will run a build, and this time (because of the configuration we put in the yml file file), it will: * Pack a .jar file, which will work for every operating system with Java * Use Linux and Windows JDKs to create standalone zips for 32 and 64 bit systems, because we can't rely on the fact that users will have a JRE * Download Butler and use it to push the new versions to the itch.io page * Read the changelog.md file to get the changes for the latest version * Upload all of these files to a new release on Github, with the release notes, which will get added to the Releases page * Send an announcement on the Discord server of the version release and release notes via webhook * Pack, Sign, and Upload a new APK to the Google Play Console at 10% rollout * The F-Droid bot checks periodically if we added a new tag. When it recognizes that we did, it will update the yaml file here * When the bot next runs and sees that there's a version it doesn't have a release for, it will attempt to build the new release. The log of the build will be added here (redirects to the latest build), and the new release will eventually be available here About Google Play publishing +We start at a 10% rollout, after a day with no major problems go to 30%, and after another day to 100%. If you were counting that means that most players will get the new version after 2+ days. + +If there were problems, we halt the current rollout, fix the problems, and release a patch version, which starts at 10% again. + +Dear future me - the automation was extremely annoying guesswork to set up, so the facts you need to know are: - There is a user at the Google Cloud Platform Account Manager called Unciv_Upload_Account. There is an access key to this account, in json, stored as the Github secret GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON. - This user was granted ADMIN permissions to the Google Play (after much trial and error since nothing else seemed to work) under User > Users and Permissions. Under Manage > Account permissions, you can see that it has Admin. Updating the wiki Pages for the Unciv Github Wiki are kept in the main repository under /docs/wiki . The process to edit the wiki is as follows: Open a pull request in the main Unciv repository that changes files under /docs/wiki . Once the pull request is merged, an account with commit privileges on the Unciv repository leaves a comment saying \" update wiki \". This comment triggers a bot to copy all the wiki files from the main repository into the Github wiki, with a link back to the PR in its commit message for credit. Doing things this way has several distinct advantages over using the Github Wiki web interface directly: Changes can be proposed via PR and proofread or fact-checked. A proper MarkDown editor or IDE can be used to write the wiki, bringing faster editing, clickable links while editing, better live HTML preview, and automatic detection of problems like broken links.

The process to edit the wiki is as follows: Open a pull request in the main Unciv repository that changes files under /docs/wiki .

This comment triggers a bot to copy all the wiki files from the main repository into the Github wiki, with a link back to the PR in its commit message for credit. Doing things this way has several distinct advantages over using the Github Wiki web interface directly: Changes can be proposed via PR and proofread or fact-checked. A proper MarkDown editor or IDE can be used to write the wiki, bringing faster editing, clickable links while editing, better live HTML preview, and automatic detection of problems like broken links.

Install Android Studio - it's free and awesome! Be aware that it's a long download! Install Git, it's the way for us to work together on this project. UI is optional, Android Studio has good Git tools built in :) Getting the code Create a Github account, if you don't already have one Fork the repo (click the \"Fork\" button on the top-right corner of https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) - this will create a \"copy\" of the code on your account, at https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv Clone your fork with git - the location will be https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv.git, visible from the green \"Clone or download\" button at https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv Load the project in Android Studio, Gradle will attempt the initial sync. If this is your first time with Android Studio, this may require you to accept the Android Build-tools licenses, which works differently on every device, so search for your OS-specific solution. A new install may not be able to do the initial sync - this comes in the form of Unable to find method ''void org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile.<init>(java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel)'' errors when you try to sync. If you have this problem go into File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK Click \"SDK Tools\" Select \"Show Package Details\" in the bottom right Choose version 30.0.3 under \"Android SDK Build-Tools \" Click \"Apply\" In Android Studio, Run > Edit configurations. Click \"+\" to add a new configuration Choose \"Application\" Set the module to Unciv.desktop , main class to com.unciv.app.desktop.DesktopLauncher and <repo_folder>\\android\\assets\\ as the Working directory, OK to close the window If you get a ../../docs/uniques.md (No such file or directory) error that means you forgot to set the working directory! Select the Desktop configuration and click the green arrow button to run! I also recommend going to Settings > Version Control > Commit and turning off 'Before commit - perform code analysis' Unciv uses Gradle to specify dependencies and how to run. In the background, the Gradle gnomes will be off fetching the packages (a one-time effort) and, once that's done, will build the project! Congratulations!

In between these are different objects of the type you are describing, each of which is contained between a \"{\" and a \"}\". For example, a very simple units.json may look like: [ { \"name\": \"Warrior\", \"cost\": 16 }, { \"name\": \"Spearman\", \"cost\": 24, \"promotions\": [\"Shock I\", \"Drill I\"] } ] This file contains two unit objects, one for a warrior and one for a spearman. These objects have different attributes, in this case \"name\", \"cost\" and \"promotions\". All these attributes have a certain type, a String (text) for \"name\", an Integer for \"cost\" and a List of Strings for \"promotions\". There are different types of attributes: | type | notes | | --------- | ----- | | String | A word or sentence. Should be between double quotes (\") | | Integer | A number. Can be both positive or negative. Should not be between quotes | | Boolean | A value that can either be 'true' or 'false'.

Each element of the list should be written like a normal attribute, seperated by comma's, and enclosed between square braces. E.g.: [\"Shock I\", \"Shock II\"] or [1, 2, 3]. | | Object | The most complicated type of attribute. An object is comprised of multiple attributes, each of which again has a type.

Note that improvements have two visual representations - icon and pixel graphic in the tileset.

That means a unit could exist with a 'Can create [this]' unique, and that the improvement will not show in a worker's improvement picker dialog. Removable Terrain features will need to be removed before building an improvement - unless the feature is named in terrainsCanBeFoundOn or the unique \"Does not need removal of [terrainFeature]\" is used (e.g. Camp allowed by resource).

If more than 1 unique is added, the notification will be shown multiple times due to a bug. excludedDifficulties List of Strings defaults to None A list of all difficulties on which this reward may not be awarded The exact algorithm for choosing a reward is the following: Create a list of all possible rewards, with rewards with a higher weight appearing multiple times. A reward with weight one will appear once, a reward with weight two will appear twice, etc. Shuffle this list Try give rewards starting from the top of the list. If any of the uniques of the rewards is valid in this context, reward it and stop trying more rewards. Notifications Some of the rewards ruins can give will have results that are not deterministic when writing it in the JSON, so creating a good notification for it would be impossible. An example for this would be the \"Gain [50]-[100] [Gold]\" unique, which will give a random amount of gold. For this reason, we allow some notifications to have parameters, in which values will be filled, such as \"You found [goldAmount] gold in the ruins!\". All the uniques which have this property can be found below. unique parameters Free [] found in the ruins The name of the unit will be filled in the notification, including unique units of the nation [] population in a random city The name of the city to which the population is added will be filled in the notification Gain []-[] [] The exact amount of the stat gained will be filled in the notification [] free random reasearchable Tech(s) from the [] The notification must have placeholders equal to the number of techs granted this way.

Unfortunately, the game only understands code, so mods are our way to give a degree of freedom to those of us who don't code. Mods can add, replace and remove basic game definitions, such as units, nations, buildings, improvements, resources and terrains. Games loaded with these mods will function according to the mod definition. The game only knows how to recognize existing definitions, so you can't add new unique abilities to nations/units/buildings/etc, only play around with existing ones There are two kinds of mods: Extension mods - these add new nations/units/buildings/resources to a base ruleset - can be either to the default ruleset, or to a base ruleset mod. Easy to do and probably the better place to get started. Base Ruleset mods - these replace the entire existing ruleset - tech tree, units, policies, nations etc - to give an entirely different experience than the base game. These generally require quite a bit of work, but give a whole new experience, and so are the most popular. Creating and editing mods from your phone is NOT RECOMMENDED - it's much easier using a desktop device! Audiovisual Mods I addition to changing the rules - or even without doing so, mods can override existing graphics or sounds, or add music tracks. The game also has the ability to display graphics that are not included in the base game at all, such as leader portrait or wonder splash images, that must be provided by mods. For details, see Audiovisual Mods . Custom tilesets are closely related, see Creating a custom tileset . Such mods are candidates for the \"Permanent audiovisual mod\" switch available on the Mod Management Screen. Note that this feature includes graphics or sounds from the selected mod in all games, even those started before installing the mod. In case of a mod bringing both changed rules and audiovisuals, the 'permanent' feature will include only the media on all games, to use the rules you will still need to select the mod for a new game. Mod names Mods need to conform to github repo naming rules, but best stay simple and use only letters, digits, and dashes - . Dashes are automatically converted to spaces for display and use within Unciv. Many punctuation or extended unicode characters might work, but at best potential users won't find them attractive, at worst we'll refuse support when you run into problems :smiling_imp: Mod components Mods are located in a /mods directory, on Desktop that should be next to your .jar file. Mods typically have 2 subfolders: - jsons - here you should put files that alter the data of game objects, the order of the files is as in the base json files . More information on these can be found here - Images - here you should put game images, as in the base image files . Please read the atlas chapter for important details. In order to remove objects from the game, you'll need to create a ModOptions file in the /jsons subfolder - there's an example here In a base ruleset mod, ALL the original objects are removed - this is done by adding a \"isBaseRuleset\":true configuration to your modOptions file, like so For an example, you can refer to the example mod - just download the Example-Aliens-Mod and put it in a /mods folder next to the jar, run Unciv, start a new game, and you'll be able to enable the mod, which will allow to you pick Aliens as a playable civilization! If you want to add a new civilization as a mod, you should check out the Civ making instructions to see what's required, or see the example Aliens mod =) More on Images and the texture atlas Images are combined (at runtime) into texture images with an 'atlas', so if you see \"game.atlas\" and \"game.png\" files being generated, now you know what for. Most mods will need only one pair of those, the base game has around four. When the game runs from a packaged distribution (android, jar), the texture+atlas files alone are relevant, so you need to include them in your repository and keep them up to date. Actually omitting the original images would work for these uses, but we still recommend including them, so developers running from source can access them. If your mod has lots of images (or large ones), the textures might 'spill' into additional texture \".png\" files - 2048x2048 is the limit for a single texture pack. This is not good for performance, which is why the base game controls which kinds of images go together into one texture(+atlas). This works for mods, too: Create not only one Images folder, but several, the additional ones named \"Images.xyz\", where xyz will become the filename of the additional texture file (So don't use both Images and Images.game - those will clash). Look at the Unciv base game to get a better idea how that works. To minimize texture swaps, try to group them by the situation where in the game they are needed.

Adding maps to mods You can also add maps to mods, so they'll be available to players who download your mod. A mod can also be maps-only, if all you want to do is share your maps. When you've finished making your map in the Map Editor, save it, and it will be in the /maps folder of your game. Copy it to a /maps folder in your mod , and you're done! Getting your mod out there In order to make your mod downloadable by anyone, you need to create a Github repository (instructions here ) The Images and jsons folders need to be in the root directory of the repo - see here for example. You can then manually download the mod from within the Mod Manager in Unciv: From Unciv's main screen, click \"Mods\" Click \"Download mod from URL\", and enter the location of your Github page The game will automatically download and extract your mod, and it'll be ready to use! Once you've tested that your mod CAN be downloaded, and that it works well once downloaded, you're ready for the final stage - GETTING IT TO THE USERS AUTOMATICALLY. In order to do this, all you need to do is: Go to your Github page Click the gear icon next to the About (top-right part of the page) In 'Topics', add \"unciv-mod\" When you open your app, it will query Github's list of repos with that topic , and now YOUR repo will appear there!

For mods which are primarily visual or audio, there is a second use - through the mod manager, you can enable them as permanent audiovisual mods . This means that the images, sounds (or upcoming: music) from the mod will replace the original media everywhere in the game. Mod location for manual loading of mods In general, you should never be manually-loading your mods - not only is this clunky, it's also more error-prone.

Unfortunately, the game only understands code, so mods are our way to give a degree of freedom to those of us who don't code. Mods can add, replace and remove basic game definitions, such as units, nations, buildings, improvements, resources and terrains. Games loaded with these mods will function according to the mod definition. The game only knows how to recognize existing definitions, so you can't add new unique abilities to nations/units/buildings/etc, only play around with existing ones There are two kinds of mods: Extension mods - these add new nations/units/buildings/resources to a base ruleset - can be either to the default ruleset, or to a base ruleset mod. Easy to do and probably the better place to get started. Base Ruleset mods - these replace the entire existing ruleset - tech tree, units, policies, nations etc - to give an entirely different experience than the base game. These generally require quite a bit of work, but give a whole new experience, and so are the most popular. Creating and editing mods from your phone is NOT RECOMMENDED - it's much easier using a desktop device!","title":"What's this about?"},{"location":"wiki/Mods/#audiovisual-mods","text":"I addition to changing the rules - or even without doing so, mods can override existing graphics or sounds, or add music tracks.

For details, see Audiovisual Mods . Custom tilesets are closely related, see Creating a custom tileset . Such mods are candidates for the \"Permanent audiovisual mod\" switch available on the Mod Management Screen. Note that this feature includes graphics or sounds from the selected mod in all games, even those started before installing the mod.

More information on these can be found here - Images - here you should put game images, as in the base image files . Please read the atlas chapter for important details. In order to remove objects from the game, you'll need to create a ModOptions file in the /jsons subfolder - there's an example here In a base ruleset mod, ALL the original objects are removed - this is done by adding a \"isBaseRuleset\":true configuration to your modOptions file, like so For an example, you can refer to the example mod - just download the Example-Aliens-Mod and put it in a /mods folder next to the jar, run Unciv, start a new game, and you'll be able to enable the mod, which will allow to you pick Aliens as a playable civilization!

Most mods will need only one pair of those, the base game has around four. When the game runs from a packaged distribution (android, jar), the texture+atlas files alone are relevant, so you need to include them in your repository and keep them up to date. Actually omitting the original images would work for these uses, but we still recommend including them, so developers running from source can access them. If your mod has lots of images (or large ones), the textures might 'spill' into additional texture \".png\" files - 2048x2048 is the limit for a single texture pack. This is not good for performance, which is why the base game controls which kinds of images go together into one texture(+atlas). This works for mods, too: Create not only one Images folder, but several, the additional ones named \"Images.xyz\", where xyz will become the filename of the additional texture file (So don't use both Images and Images.game - those will clash). Look at the Unciv base game to get a better idea how that works. To minimize texture swaps, try to group them by the situation where in the game they are needed.

Sometimes you may not need to do anything, sometimes you will add a line to the translation templates , and sometimes you will adapt the string formatting to support the translations. For details, see the 'Translation generation - for developers' chapter . Major classes Civ, and therefore Unciv, is a game with endless interconnectivity - everything affects everything else. In order to have some semblance of order, we'll go over the main classes in the order in which they are serialized. So yes, you can - for instance - get the center tile of a city, a TileInfo, directly from CityInfo. But delving into all the connections would only harm the point of this overview, that's what the actual code is for ;) The Game State: GameInfo CivilizationInfo CityInfo TileMap TileInfo MapUnit RuleSet (unique in that it is not part of the game state) The UI: MainMenuScreen NewGameScreen WorldScreen CityScreen MapEditorScreen Picker Screens - TechPickerScreen, PolicyPickerScreen, ImprovementPickerScreen, PromotionPickerScreen Game State The Game - GameInfo First off, let's clarify: When we say \"The Game\", we mean the state of the game (what turn it is, who the players are, what each one has etc) and not the UI of the game. That is, The Game is the currently played game, not Unciv . The game contains three major parts: The list of the players, or civilizations - List<CivilizationInfo> The map upon which the game is played - TileMap The ruleset by which the game is played - RuleSet . This includes what technologies, buildings, units etc. are available, and IS NOT serialized and deserialized, but comes straight from the game files - more on that later. Parameters unique to this game - difficulty, game speed, victory conditions, etc. When we save the game, or load the game, we're actually serializing and deserializing this class, which means that the this class is the root of the entire game state. Most objects in the \"state tree\" have a transient reference to their parent, meaning the tree can be traversed in-code in all directions, and frequently is. A Civilization - CivilizationInfo This represents one of the players of the game, and NOT a specific nation - meaning, not France, but rather \"Player X who is France in this game\". In another game, there will be another France. As one of the focal points of the game, it contains a lot of important information, the most important of which are: The list of cities the civilization has - List<CityInfo> Which nation this is - references a certain Nation (part of the ruleset) Various Managers for the different aspects of the civilization - PolicyManager , GoldenAgeManager , GreatPersonManager , TechManager , VictoryManager , DiplomacyManager A City - CityInfo This contains the information about a specific city. Beyond basic information like name, location on map etc, the most important classes it contains are: Calculating the yield of the city - CityStats Managers for the various aspects - PopulationManager , CityConstructions , CityExpansionManager The tiles controlled and worked by the city - only their locations are permanently saved in the CityInfo, the actual information is in the TileInfo in the TileMap The map - TileMap This contains mostly helper functions and acts as a wrapper for the list of tiles it contains A tile - TileInfo Each tile is comprised of several layers, and so has information for each. Tiles have, primarily: - A base terrain - Grassland, Hills, Desert etc. References a certain Terrain (part of the ruleset) - An optional terrain feature - Forest, Jungle, Oasis etc. References a certain Terrain (part of the ruleset) - An optional resource - Iron, Dye, Wheat etc. References a certain TileResource (part of the ruleset) - An improvement built on the tile, if any. References a certain TileImprovement (part of the ruleset) - The units that are currently in the tile - MapUnit A unit on the map - MapUnit Unlike buildings, Unit in Unciv has two meanings. One is a Type of unit (like Spearman), and one is a specific instance of a unit (say, a Babylonian Spearman, at a certain position, with X health). MapUnit is a specific instance of a unit, whereas BaseUnit is the type of unit. Main information: - A name - references a specific BaseUnit - Health and Movement - Promotion status - UnitPromotions Ruleset So far so good - but what of everything that makes Civ, Civ? The units, the buildings, the nations, the improvements etc? Since these things remain the same for every game, these are not saved on a per-game basis, but rather are saved in json files in Unciv's asset folder. Each class in the game state that saves one of these will reference it by name, and when the game is running it will check the Ruleset to find the relevant information for that object. The various objects are: - Technology - referenced mainly in CivilizationInfo.TechManager - Nations - referenced mainly in CivilizationInfo - Policy - referenced mainly in CivilizationInfo.PolicyManager (seeing a pattern here?) - Building - referenced mainly in CityInfo.ConstructionManager - BaseUnit - referenced mainly in MapUnit - Promotion - referenced mainly in MapUnit - Terrain - referenced mainly in TileInfo - TileResource - referenced mainly in TileInfo - TileImprovement - referenced mainly in TileInfo There are also Translations in the Ruleset, but they technically have nothing to do with the game state but rather with the UI display. The information for all of these is in json files in android\\assets\\jsons UI UncivGame is the 'base' class for the UI, from which everything starts, but it itself doesn't do much. When we change a screen, we're changing a value in UncivGame, the interesting stuff happens in the screens themselves. The main menu - MainMenuScreen This is what the user sees when first entering the game. It acts as a hub to loading games, adding mods, options etc, without loading an actual game upfront - this allows us to differentiate between \"User can't enter game\" and \"User can't load game\" problems Starting a new game - NewGameScreen This is basically a giant setting screen for GameOptions and MapOptions classes, divided into: GameOptionsTable - game speed, mods, etc MapOptionsTable - either from preexisting map file or generated, in which case: size, map generation type, etc. PlayerPickerTable - What civs are in the game and who controls them The World Screen - WorldScreen 90% of the game is spent on this screen, so naturally it's the fullest, with the most things happening. This is the main hub of the game, with all other screens being opened from it, and closing back to reveal it. Most notable are: * The map itself - a TileMapHolder - with each of the rendered tiles being a TileGroup * The information panels - WorldScreenTopBar for stats and resources, UnitTable for the currently selected unit, TileInfoTable or the currently selected tile, BattleTable for battle simulation, and NotificationsScroll for the notifications * The minimap - MinimapHolder * Buttons linking to other screens - to the TechPickerScreen , EmpireOverviewScreen , and PolicyPickerScreen * The almighty Next Turn button The city screen - CityScreen The second-most important screen. Notable parts: * the City Stats table - should definitely be its own class come to think of it * The construction list and current construction (bottom left) - ConstructionsTable * Existing buildings, specialists and stats drilldown - CityInfoTable Others A few words need to be said about the NextTurn process, but there isn't really a good place for it so I'll put it here. We clone the GameInfo and use a \"new\" GameInfo for each turn because of 2 reasons. The first is multithreading and thread safety, and the second is multiplayer reproducibility. The first point is pretty basic. The NextTurn needs to happen in a separate thread so that the user can still have a responsive game when it's off doing stuff. Stuff in the GameInfo changes on NextTurn, so if you're rendering that same GameInfo, this could cause conflicts. Also, after NextTurn we generally autosave, and if stuff changes in the state while we're trying to serialize it to put it in the save file, that's Not Fun. A single clone solves both of these problems at once. The second point is less obvious. If we use our mutable state, changing stuff in place, then what happens when we're playing in Multiplayer?

The region type corresponds to the start bias of the civs as they are distributed. The region type also determines start placement and what luxuries will appear in the region. Example ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63475501/140308518-ad5a2f50-d5f1-4467-a296-3a67f6d0b007.png) How to define region behavior in your mod The game will work without any extra json definitions, but if you want the region system to work well when generating maps for your mod, these are the relevant uniques to define. Terrains.json \"Always Fertility [amount] for Map Generation\", \"[amount] to Fertility for Map Generation\" - these determine how good a terrain is for purposes of dividing land up fairly. The numbers are arbitrary but should reflect the relative value of the terrains. \"A Region is formed with at least [amount]% [simpleTerrain] tiles, with priority [amount]\", \"A Region is formed with at least [amount]% [simpleTerrain] tiles and [simpleTerrain] tiles, with priority [amount]\" - these determine the rules for when a region is classified as eg a \"desert\" region. Terrains are evaluated in ascending priority order, so in the base ruleset tundra regions are checked first. \"A Region can not contain more [simpleTerrain] tiles than [simpleTerrain] tiles\" - a useful compliment to the sum-of-two-terrains criterium above, if both terrains are in and of themselves terrain types. So in the base ruleset a large enough sum of jungle and forest allows a region to be classified as jungle, but only if there is more jungle than forest. \"Base Terrain on this tile is not counted for Region determination\" - for terrain features that are unremovable or otherwise dominate the tile. Used for Hills in the base ruleset.

Sometimes, new strings (names, uniques, etc) are added in the json files. In order to not have to add every single one to the translation files manually, we have a class - TranslationFileWriter - that, for every language: Goes over the template.properties and copies translation lines For every json file in the jsons folder Selects all string values - both in objects, and in arrays in objects Generates a 'key = value' line This means that every text that ISN'T in the jsons needs to be added manually to the template.properties in order to be translated! That also means if you've been adding new json structures you (or someone) should check TranslationFileWriter and see if it is able to cope with them. Rules for templates added manually Building a new UI and doing something like popup.add(\"Hello world\".toLabel()) is a typical case: This is not contained in json data, so you'll have to add the template to template.properties yourself. For this example, adding Hello world = somewhere in a line of its own could suffice. Note the space at the end - it's absolutely required, and see to it your editor does not destroy your work. If you want to make sure, use Android Studio for git integration, but edit the file in an external editor, then run the unit tests locally before pushing. (to do: add link for instructions how to do that) Leading spaces on a translation line or more than one space between the text and the = would mean these spaces are a key part of the string to be translated .

In terms of UI, there's nothing here that hasn't been done dozens of times, with far greater polish. However, there is one area where Unciv is groundbreaking: in its accessibility of translations, the possibility space of its mods, and the relationship between them. Translations The translation process So let's start with translation. Surely this is a solved problem, right? Source text + language = translated text, and this information needs to be in a file so the game can read it. What makes us different from, for example, Firaxis? There are a couple of things, but the most significant is that this is an open-source game, and thus the translations are open-source as well. This means translators are both amateurs and not obligated to translate, so if translating is difficult, they simply won't. Amateurs can make mistakes, which is why it's vital that mistakes are easy to spot. That means that formats like \"translation key\" - e.g. DIPLOMACY_GREETING = Siamo lieti di fare la vostra conoscenza. are much less effective than A pleasure to meet you. = Siamo lieti di fare la vostra conoscenza. This format lends itself both the easier translation (it's immediately obvious what needs to be translated) and actual collaboration. A common suggestion that we get (by people with little familiarity with the project) is to \"use a website for translation\". This is not bad advice for a small open source game, but there are multiple disadvantages that (for now) no translation website provides enough advantage to outweigh: Testing . Currently, translations undergo a number of tests for verification - more on that later! This allows some language changes to be accepted and others not, and it's all in the same platform with the same tests. External translation tools don't allow for this. History and revisions . This is what Git was made for, and nothing like it exists in the world. By itself this would not Release cycle . We release versions semiweekly, and if we needed to upload changes to the translation website for every in-game change, and download them for every release, that's extra work. For some websites this is automate-able - for most it is not. Discussions . Most crowdsourcing translation websites don't allow for discussions and corrections on translations. Github makes every translation collaborative work. Mass changes . If we're changing the source of the translation but want to keep the various destinations (say, we change \"Gold from trade routes +[amount]%\" to \"+[amount]% Gold from trade routes\"), if all the translation files are in Git we can do that in 1 minute. If it's external, this varies greatly. Here are some ways that we managed to go wrong in the past: Putting all languages into the same file (\"one big translation dictionary\") - when multiple people edit this file for different languages, they can conflict with each other. Separate to different files for simpler management. Using json - json is great for machines, but less so for humans, who can easily make mistakes. Json format is surprisingly finnicky, miss a closing \" and the whole file is now unreadable. The format we decided to go for is one file per language, delimited by \" = \" for visual separation, in a .properties file. Lines starting in # are considered comments, so we can add comments for translators. Building the translation files As stated, Unciv releases versions semiweekly, and very often these changes include new objects or new UI elements. How do we keep all translation files up to date? In Unciv, all object data is stored in json format. This allows us to iterate on all objects, regardless of type, and extract the various text fields (strings or lists of strings). We avoid duplication by saving all translation texts we've already added, and use the existing translations to populate the \"value\" for each translation \"key\" we found in the json files. Since we rebuild the entire translation file every time, there's currently no way for translators to retain their own comments for future translators. But on the other hand, since for each line that we add we already know if it's translated or not, this allows us to add a # Requires translation line before every non-translated line, which helps translators for languages that are almost fully translated to easily locate the new or changed terms for translation with ctrl+f (and of course this marking will disappear the next time we rebuild the file). Since there are UI texts that are not part of any specific object (like \"Start new game\"), we have a separate template.properties file for texts to translate that are not in the json files. Unlike adding objects, where the developer doesn't need to address the translation files at all since it's all linked, when adding UI elements with new texts devs need to remember to add the texts to template.properties file. Translation placeholders This is all well and good for specific text-to-text translations, but what about translating \"A Temple has been built in Rome\"? The same template could potentially be any building name, or any city name! We do this with placeholders, which looks something like this: [construction] has been built in [cityName] = [cityName] ha costruito [construction] . As you can see, the placement of the parameters can change between languages, so we have to name all parameters. This also means that there can be explicitly wrong translations - if any parameter that appears in the source does not appear in the translated version, we won't be able to display this in-game! This is one of the translation tests that we mentioned earlier - when a translator opens a PR, the game undergoes build & test via the Github Actions, and will notify on failures. Finding the text that warns of the failure within the action output is currently mostly done by devs, but I hope to be able to automate this too someday. To translate a text like \"[Temple] has been built in [Rome]\", therefore, we need to: - Find the relevant translation (we do this by erasing all text between square brackets in input and finding the relevant translation text) - Map placeholder names to input text (construction = Temple, cityName = Rome) - Replace placeholders in translation with TRANSLATED input text (in [cityName] ha costruito [construction] , replace \"[cityName]\" with translation of \"Rome\", and \"[construction]\" with translation of \"Temple\") Translating mod data The translation generation reads information from \"a ruleset\", i.e. the set of jsons defining the game's objects. Every mod is also a ruleset, either replacing or adding to the base ruleset defined in the game. This means that the same translation generation that we do for the base game can also be applied to mods, and so each modder can decide (from within the game) to generate translation files for his mod, and since mods are uploaded to Github to be widely available as part of the mod release methodology, translators will be able to translate those files the exact same way that they translate Unciv's base ruleset. Uniques Moddable unique effects Every object in Unciv can include \"uniques\" - a list of strings, each granting a unique effect that is not applicable for every object of its type. For example, the Palace building has the unique \"Indicates the capital city\", and the settler has the unique \"Founds a new city\". This allows us to share effects between multiple units, and to avoid hardcoding and allow modders to add any effect to any object. Here too we encounter the problem of \"generic\" uniques - how can we have these effects grant a building, some stats, etc, using the same unique for all objects? Why, with placeholders of course! For example, one building has \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\", where \"Library\" can be replaced with any other building for similar effects. We can then extract the parameters from the unique at runtime, to know how to resolve the unique's effects. Since the translation template is the same as the unique template, these uniques are instantly translatable as well! We do have a slight problem, though - since translation texts come directly from the json files, and the json files have \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\", how do we tell the translators not to directly translate \"Library\" but the take the parameter name verbatim? Well, 95% of translation parameters fit nicely into a certain type - units, buildings, techs, terrains etc. So we can search for an object with than name, and since we find a Library building, we can put \"Requires a [buildingName] in all cities = \" as our translation line. Filters As time went on, we noticed that many of our \"uniques\" weren't so unique after all. Many were the same but with slightly different conditions. One affects all cities, one only coastal cities, and one only the city the building is built in. One affects Mounted units, one affects wounded units, one affects all water units, etc. We started compiling these conditions into \"filters\", which limited the number of uniques while expanding their range considerably. Take the following example unique for a building: \"[+1 Food] from [Deer] tiles [in this city]\". In its \"placeholder\" form, this is \"[stats] from [tileFilter] tiles [cityFilter]\". stats can accept any list of stats, e.g. '-2 Gold, +1 Science', '+3 Culture', etc. tileFilter can accept any number of tile parameters (base terrain e.g. 'Plains', terrain type eg. 'Land'/'Water', terrain features e.g. 'Forest', improvements e.g. 'Mine', resources e.g. 'Iron'. cityFilter can accept 'in this city', 'in all cities', 'in capital', 'in coastal cities', etc. There are also filters for units, all acceptable values are documented here . Unique management with Enums The further along we go, the more generic the uniques become, and the more of them there are. Older uniques become new ones, by being merged or made more generic, and the older ones are deprecated. Deprecation notices are put on Discord, but a one-time message is easy to miss, and if you come back after a while you don't know what's changed. Modders discover during gameplay that the values they put for uniques were incorrect. All these problems are solved with a single solution - since all uniques are defined by their text, we can create an enum with ALL existing uniques, which lets us: Find all usages of a unique in the IDE instantly Mark deprecated uniques as such using @Deprecated(\"as of <versionNumber\">) for devs (and modders!) Compare uniques using enum values, which is faster What's more, with a little bit of autodetection magic, we can determine the type of the parameter using its text. Using the above example, \"[stats] from [tileFilter] tiles [cityFilter]\", we can tell by the names of the parameters what each one is supposed to be,. We can then check at loading time for each unique, if its parameter values matches the parameter type it's supposed to have, which lets us catch incorrect parameters. The \"autodetection\" of parameter types for translations can also be fed from here, leading to much more accurate translation texts - instead of detecting from an example (e.g. \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\" from the json), we now use a dev-inputted value like \"Requires a [buildingName] in all cities\". This allows us to accept multiple types, like for e.g. \"Requires [buildingName/techName/policyName]\". Deprecated values can be detected due to the @Deprecated annotation, and can be displayed to the modders when loading the mod, together with the correct replacement. Conditionals Beyond the existing filters for units, buildings, tiles etc, there are some conditions that are global. For example, uniques that take effect when the empire is happy; when a tech has been researched; when the empire is at war; etc. Rather than being 'build in' to specific uniques, these conditions can be seen as extensions of existing uniques and thus globally relevant. For example, instead of \"[+1 Production] [in all cities] when empire is happy\", we can extract the conditional to \"[+1 Production] [in all cities] \". This does two things: A. Turns the 'extra' unique back into a regular \"[stats] [cityFilter]\" unique B. Turns the conditional into an extra piece that can be added onto any other unique Conditionals have a lot of nuance, especially regarding translation and ordering, so work in that field is more gradual. What's next? We have yet to fully map all existing uniques and convert all textual references in the code to Enum usages, and have yet to extract all conditionals from their uniques. We already have a map of what uniques can be put on what objects - it won't take much to add that check as well and warn against uniques that are put on the wrong sorts of objects. Once we build the full inventory of the uniques, instead of the wiki page that needs to be updated manually we'll be able to generate a list of all acceptable uniques and their parameters directly from the source of truth. Put that in a webpage, add hover-links for each parameter type, generate and upload to github.io every version, and watch the magic happen. We'll also be able to notify modders if they use \"unknown\" uniques.","title":"Translations, mods, and modding freedom in Open Source"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#translations","text":"","title":"Translations"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#the-translation-process","text":"So let's start with translation.

If we're changing the source of the translation but want to keep the various destinations (say, we change \"Gold from trade routes +[amount]%\" to \"+[amount]% Gold from trade routes\"), if all the translation files are in Git we can do that in 1 minute. If it's external, this varies greatly. Here are some ways that we managed to go wrong in the past: Putting all languages into the same file (\"one big translation dictionary\") - when multiple people edit this file for different languages, they can conflict with each other. Separate to different files for simpler management. Using json - json is great for machines, but less so for humans, who can easily make mistakes. Json format is surprisingly finnicky, miss a closing \" and the whole file is now unreadable. The format we decided to go for is one file per language, delimited by \" = \" for visual separation, in a .properties file. Lines starting in # are considered comments, so we can add comments for translators.","title":"The translation process"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#building-the-translation-files","text":"As stated, Unciv releases versions semiweekly, and very often these changes include new objects or new UI elements. How do we keep all translation files up to date? In Unciv, all object data is stored in json format. This allows us to iterate on all objects, regardless of type, and extract the various text fields (strings or lists of strings). We avoid duplication by saving all translation texts we've already added, and use the existing translations to populate the \"value\" for each translation \"key\" we found in the json files. Since we rebuild the entire translation file every time, there's currently no way for translators to retain their own comments for future translators. But on the other hand, since for each line that we add we already know if it's translated or not, this allows us to add a # Requires translation line before every non-translated line, which helps translators for languages that are almost fully translated to easily locate the new or changed terms for translation with ctrl+f (and of course this marking will disappear the next time we rebuild the file). Since there are UI texts that are not part of any specific object (like \"Start new game\"), we have a separate template.properties file for texts to translate that are not in the json files. Unlike adding objects, where the developer doesn't need to address the translation files at all since it's all linked, when adding UI elements with new texts devs need to remember to add the texts to template.properties file.","title":"Building the translation files"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#translation-placeholders","text":"This is all well and good for specific text-to-text translations, but what about translating \"A Temple has been built in Rome\"? The same template could potentially be any building name, or any city name! We do this with placeholders, which looks something like this: [construction] has been built in [cityName] = [cityName] ha costruito [construction] . As you can see, the placement of the parameters can change between languages, so we have to name all parameters. This also means that there can be explicitly wrong translations - if any parameter that appears in the source does not appear in the translated version, we won't be able to display this in-game! This is one of the translation tests that we mentioned earlier - when a translator opens a PR, the game undergoes build & test via the Github Actions, and will notify on failures. Finding the text that warns of the failure within the action output is currently mostly done by devs, but I hope to be able to automate this too someday. To translate a text like \"[Temple] has been built in [Rome]\", therefore, we need to: - Find the relevant translation (we do this by erasing all text between square brackets in input and finding the relevant translation text) - Map placeholder names to input text (construction = Temple, cityName = Rome) - Replace placeholders in translation with TRANSLATED input text (in [cityName] ha costruito [construction] , replace \"[cityName]\" with translation of \"Rome\", and \"[construction]\" with translation of \"Temple\")","title":"Translation placeholders"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#translating-mod-data","text":"The translation generation reads information from \"a ruleset\", i.e. the set of jsons defining the game's objects.

This means that the same translation generation that we do for the base game can also be applied to mods, and so each modder can decide (from within the game) to generate translation files for his mod, and since mods are uploaded to Github to be widely available as part of the mod release methodology, translators will be able to translate those files the exact same way that they translate Unciv's base ruleset.","title":"Translating mod data"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#uniques","text":"","title":"Uniques"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#moddable-unique-effects","text":"Every object in Unciv can include \"uniques\" - a list of strings, each granting a unique effect that is not applicable for every object of its type. For example, the Palace building has the unique \"Indicates the capital city\", and the settler has the unique \"Founds a new city\". This allows us to share effects between multiple units, and to avoid hardcoding and allow modders to add any effect to any object. Here too we encounter the problem of \"generic\" uniques - how can we have these effects grant a building, some stats, etc, using the same unique for all objects? Why, with placeholders of course! For example, one building has \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\", where \"Library\" can be replaced with any other building for similar effects. We can then extract the parameters from the unique at runtime, to know how to resolve the unique's effects. Since the translation template is the same as the unique template, these uniques are instantly translatable as well! We do have a slight problem, though - since translation texts come directly from the json files, and the json files have \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\", how do we tell the translators not to directly translate \"Library\" but the take the parameter name verbatim? Well, 95% of translation parameters fit nicely into a certain type - units, buildings, techs, terrains etc. So we can search for an object with than name, and since we find a Library building, we can put \"Requires a [buildingName] in all cities = \" as our translation line.","title":"Moddable unique effects"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#filters","text":"As time went on, we noticed that many of our \"uniques\" weren't so unique after all. Many were the same but with slightly different conditions. One affects all cities, one only coastal cities, and one only the city the building is built in. One affects Mounted units, one affects wounded units, one affects all water units, etc. We started compiling these conditions into \"filters\", which limited the number of uniques while expanding their range considerably. Take the following example unique for a building: \"[+1 Food] from [Deer] tiles [in this city]\". In its \"placeholder\" form, this is \"[stats] from [tileFilter] tiles [cityFilter]\". stats can accept any list of stats, e.g. '-2 Gold, +1 Science', '+3 Culture', etc. tileFilter can accept any number of tile parameters (base terrain e.g. 'Plains', terrain type eg. 'Land'/'Water', terrain features e.g. 'Forest', improvements e.g. 'Mine', resources e.g. 'Iron'. cityFilter can accept 'in this city', 'in all cities', 'in capital', 'in coastal cities', etc. There are also filters for units, all acceptable values are documented here .","title":"Filters"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#unique-management-with-enums","text":"The further along we go, the more generic the uniques become, and the more of them there are. Older uniques become new ones, by being merged or made more generic, and the older ones are deprecated. Deprecation notices are put on Discord, but a one-time message is easy to miss, and if you come back after a while you don't know what's changed. Modders discover during gameplay that the values they put for uniques were incorrect. All these problems are solved with a single solution - since all uniques are defined by their text, we can create an enum with ALL existing uniques, which lets us: Find all usages of a unique in the IDE instantly Mark deprecated uniques as such using @Deprecated(\"as of <versionNumber\">) for devs (and modders!) Compare uniques using enum values, which is faster What's more, with a little bit of autodetection magic, we can determine the type of the parameter using its text. Using the above example, \"[stats] from [tileFilter] tiles [cityFilter]\", we can tell by the names of the parameters what each one is supposed to be,. We can then check at loading time for each unique, if its parameter values matches the parameter type it's supposed to have, which lets us catch incorrect parameters. The \"autodetection\" of parameter types for translations can also be fed from here, leading to much more accurate translation texts - instead of detecting from an example (e.g. \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\" from the json), we now use a dev-inputted value like \"Requires a [buildingName] in all cities\". This allows us to accept multiple types, like for e.g. \"Requires [buildingName/techName/policyName]\". Deprecated values can be detected due to the @Deprecated annotation, and can be displayed to the modders when loading the mod, together with the correct replacement.","title":"Unique management with Enums"},{"location":"wiki/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#conditionals","text":"Beyond the existing filters for units, buildings, tiles etc, there are some conditions that are global. For example, uniques that take effect when the empire is happy; when a tech has been researched; when the empire is at war; etc. Rather than being 'build in' to specific uniques, these conditions can be seen as extensions of existing uniques and thus globally relevant. For example, instead of \"[+1 Production] [in all cities] when empire is happy\", we can extract the conditional to \"[+1 Production] [in all cities] \". This does two things: A. Turns the 'extra' unique back into a regular \"[stats] [cityFilter]\" unique B.

For example, a building's stat increase, cost and required tech; a unit's type, movement and attack; a resource's type, improvement and bonus stats from improvement. All such traits have their own fields in the said object types. But there are also other traits, that are only in a small subset of objects will have. Units that can see submarines from more than one tile away, or can move after attacking, or has a combat bonus against a certain other type of unit. Buildings that give a free great person, or improve stats dependent on the population of a city, or provide extra yield to certain tiles. These traits cannot be given their own fields due to the huge number of them. Instead, every special trait that an object has is encoded into a single parameter: the list of unique traits, or \"uniques\". In the json files, this looks something like \"uniques\": [\"Requires a [Market] in all cities\", \"Cost increases by [30] per owned city\"] . As seen in the above example, in order to provide flexibility and generalization, Uniques have certain parameters , marked by the fact that they are inside square braces. These parameters can be changed, and the game will recognize the text inside them and act accordingly. A list of all available uniques can be found here . Generated Documentation This part of the wiki is human-edited and partially out of date. However, we now have automatically generated documentation, complete for all Uniques that have been updated to the new UniqueType system. It is part of the main source tree and can be found here. . This version should always be up-to-date with the uniques and conditionals currently supported in the game. Unique locations Most uniques are \"Global uniques\" - meaning, they can be put in one of these places: - Nation uniques - Always active for a specific Nation - Policy uniques - Active once the policy has been chosen - Building uniques - Active once the building has been constructed in any city - Tech uniques - Active once the tech has been researched - Era uniques - Active once in the specified era - Religion uniques - Founder & Enhancer beliefs from your religion Most uniques are ongoing - they describe something continuous. Some, however, are one-time actions (free technology, free unit, etc) - these cannot be put in a Nation unique, since unlike the other categories, there is no specific time to activate them. Such uniques will be marked in the documentation as \"one time effect\". Parameter types Parameters come in various types, and will be addressed as such inside the [square brackets]. amount - This indicates a whole number, possibly with a + or - sign, such as \"2\", \"+13\", or \"-3\". unitName, buildingName, improvementName etc - Rather self explanatory. Examples: \"Warrior\", \"Library\", and \"Mine\", accordingly. stat - This is one of the 7 major stats in the game - \"Gold\", \"Science\", \"Production\", \"Food\", \"Happiness\", \"Culture\" and \"Faith\". Note that the stat names need to be capitalized! stats, tileFilter, unitFilter, cityFilter, constructionFilter/buildingFilter - these are more complex and are addressed individually stats This indicates a text comprised of specific stats and is slightly more complex. Each stats is comprised of several stat changes, each in the form of \"+{amount} {stat}\", where 'stat' is one of the seven major stats mentioned above. For example: \"+1 Science\". These can be strung together with \", \" between them, for example: \"+2 Production, +3 Food\". A full example would be, for the \"[stats] from every [buildingName]\" unique: \"[+1 Culture, +1 Gold] from every [Barracks]\" tileFilter TileFilters are split up into two parts: terrainFilters and improvementFilters. TerrainFilters only check if the tile itself has certain characteristics, while the improvementFilters only checks the improvement on a tile. Using the tileFilter itself will check both of these. terrainFilters allow us to specify tiles according to a number of different aspects: A filter names a specific json attribute (by name): Base terrain Terrain features Base terrain uniques Terrain feature uniques Resource Natural wonder Or the filter is a constant string choosing a derived test: \"All\" \"Water\", \"Land\" \"Coastal\" (at least one direct neighbor is a coast) \"River\" (as in all 'river on tile' contexts, it means 'adjacent to a river on at least one side') \"Open terrain\", \"Rough terrain\" (note all terrain not having the rough unique is counted as open) \"Friendly Land\" - land belonging to you, or other civs with open borders to you \"Foreign Land\" - any land that isn't friendly land \"Enemy land\" - any land belonging to a civ you are at war with \"Water resource\", \"Strategic resource\", \"Luxury resource\", \"Bonus resource\" \"Natural Wonder\" (as opposed to above which means testing for a specific Natural Wonder by name, this tests for any of them) Please note all of these are case-sensitive . Also note: Resource filters depend on whether a viewing civ is known in the context where the filter runs. Water and specific tests require a viewing civ, and if the resource needs a tech to be visible, that tech to be researched by the viewing civ. The other resource category tests can succeed without a known viewing civ only for resources not requiring any tech. So - test your mod! So for instance, the unique \"[stats] from [tileFilter] tiles [cityFilter]\" can match several cases: - \"[+2 Food] from [Lakes] tiles [in this city]\" - \"[+1 Gold] from [Water] tiles [in all cities]\" - \"[+1 Production] from [Forest] tiles [in all coastal cities]\" Please note that using resources is most use cases, but not in combat ones. This is due to the fact that resources can be visible to some civs while invisible to others - so if you're attacking with a +10% combat bonus from Coal, while the enemy can't see coal, it could get weird. improvementFilters only check for the improvements on a tile. The following are implemented: - improvement name (Note that \"Road\" and \"Railroad\" do work as improvementFilters, but not as tileFilters at the moment.) - \"All\" - \"Great Improvements\", \"Great\" - \"All Road\" - for Roads & Railroads unitFilter unitFilters allow us to activate uniques for specific units, based on: unit name unit type - e.g. Melee, Ranged, WaterSubmarine, etc. \"Land\", \"Water\", \"Air\" \"land units\", \"water units\", \"air units\" \"non-air\" for non-air non-missile units \"Military\", \"military units\" \"Civilian\", \"civilian units\" \"All\" \"Melee\" \"Ranged\" \"Nuclear Weapon\" \"Great Person\", \"Great\" \"Embarked\" \"Wounded\", \"wounded units\" \"Barbarians\", \"Barbarian\" \"City-State\" Any exact unique the unit has Any exact unique the unit type has Any combination of the above (will match only if all match). The format is \"{filter1} {filter2}\" and can match any number of filters. For example: \"[{Military} {Water}]\" units, \"[{Wounded} {Armor}]\" units, etc. No space or other text is allowed between the \"[\" and the first \"{\". cityFilter cityFilters allow us to choose the range of cities affected by this unique: \"in this city\" \"in all cities\" \"in other cities\" \"in all coastal cities\" \"in capital\" \"in all non-occupied cities\" - all cities that are not puppets and don't have extra unhappiness from being recently conquered \"in all cities with a world wonder\" \"in all cities connected to capital\" \"in all cities with a garrison\" \"in non-enemy foreign cities\" - In all cities owned by civs other than you that you are not at war with \"in foreign cities\" \"in annexed cities\" \"in holy cities\" \"in City-State cities\" \"in cities following this religion\" - Should only be used in pantheon/follower uniques for religions \"in all cities in which the majority religion is a major religion\" \"in all cities in which the majority religion is a enhanced religion\" constructionFilter ConstructionFilters allow us to activate uniques while constructing certain buildings or units. For units, the UnitFilter is called. For Buildings, the following options are implemented: \"All\" \"Buildings\", \"Building\" \"Wonders\", \"Wonders\" \"National Wonder\" \"World Wonder\" -- All wonders that are not national wonders building name The name of the building it replaces (so for example uniques for libraries will apply to paper makers as well) an exact unique the building has (e.g.: \"spaceship part\") \"Culture\", \"Gold\", etc. if the building is \"stat-related\" for that stat. Stat-related buildings are defined as one of the following: Provides that stat directly (e.g. +1 Culture) Provides a percentage bonus for that stat (e.g. +10% Production) Provides that stat as a bonus for resources (e.g. +1 Food for Wheat) Provides that stat per some amount of population (e.g. +1 Science for every 2 population [cityFilter]) Conditionals Some uniques also allow for the placing of conditionals. These are conditions that need to be met for the unique to be active. In the unique \"[+10]% Growth \\<when at war>\", the <when at war> part is a conditional, denoted by the pointy brackets. Making a building with this unique will provide a 10% Growth boost to cities with this building, but only as long as the empire is at war. Multiple conditionals can be applied to the same unique, for example, you can have a promotion with the following unique: \"[+33]% Strength \\<vs [Armored] units> \\<in [Open terrain] tiles>\" Which will only apply the strength boost when fighting armored units in open terrain. This system is currently in development, so only a small amount of conditionals exist, and only a few uniques can have conditionals for now. It will be expanded greatly, improving the amount of combinations that can be made and therefore the amount of different uniques that exist. Uniques that support conditionals will be denoted with a \"\u00a9\" sign for now. \"Quantity of Resources gifted by City-States increased by 100%\" - Replaced with \"Quantity of Resources gifted by City-States increased by [amount]%\"","title":"Uniques"},{"location":"wiki/Uniques/#overview","text":"Every type of object has some traits that are shared across all, or most, objects of its kind.
