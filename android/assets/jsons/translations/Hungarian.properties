# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

Over time, Persian might expanded into far away Macedonia, at the very door of the upstart Greek city-states. Long would Persia prosper until the upstart villain Alexander of Macedon, destroyed the great empire in one shocking campaign. =

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10,000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, however, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks who fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and through a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological superiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! =

Your men stand proudly to greet you, Great Attila, grand warrior and ruler of the Hunnic empire.

You bowed the Eastern Roman Emperors to your will and took kingdom after kingdom along the Danube and Nisava Rivers. As the sovereign ruler of the Huns, you marched your army across Europe into Gaul, planning to extend your already impressive lands all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Your untimely death led to the quick disintegration and downfall of your empire, but your name and deeds have created an everlasting legacy for your people. =

Introduction = Bevezetés
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = Üdvözöllek az Unciv játékban!\nMivel ez egy komplex játék, így segítek néhány egyszerű feladattal, hogy megismerd a játékot.\nEzek teljesen opcionálisak és akár egyedül is megismerheted a játékot!

New Game = Új játék
Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = Az első feladatod, hogy megalapítsd a fővárosod.\nEz egy nagyon fontos feladat, ugyanis a fővárosod lesz a legvirágzóbb.\nRengeteg bónusz egyedül a fővárosodra érvényes és ez lesz a birodalmad központja.
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to watch out for! = Honnan tudhatod, hogy megfelelő lesz-e a terület?\nEz nem egy egyszerű kérdés, de az egyik legjobb szempont, hogy keress luxus alapanyagokat és ezek mellé telepedj le.\nA luxus alapanyagok azok a területek, amelyeken drágakövek, pamut vagy selyem található (egy smiley jelöli az alapanyag ikonja mellett)\nEzek az alapanyagok boldoggá teszik a civilizációdat. Ezek mellett azért figyelj arra is, hogy olyan alapanyagok is a közelben legyenek, amik különböző egységek gyártásához kellenek, mint például vas. A városok nem lehetnek 3 területen belül egymáshoz, ez egy másik dolog amire figyelned kell!
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = Szerencsére a városok nem csak azokon a területeken gazdálkodhatnak amelyeken épültek vagy a közvetlen közelben vannak!\nEz azt jelenti, hogy nem kell közvetlenül az alapanyag mellé telepedned.\nVegyük például, hogy szeretnél vashoz hozzáférni, de az egy sivatag mellett helyezkedik.\nEbben az esetben nem kell a sivatag mellé telepedned. Nyugodtan helyezheted a városodat egy virágzóbb területre.\nA városod idővel növekedésnek fog indulni és egy idő után hozzáférsz majd a nyersanyaghoz.\nEgyedül akkor szükséges az alapanyag mellé települnöd, hogy ha egyből szeretnél hozzáférni, ami kezdetben még szempont, de később már nem lesz az.
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = Az első dolog amit a városodnak érdemes kiképeznie az egy felderítő vagy egy harcos.\nÉn személy szerint a harcost választaná, mert lehet védekezésre használni és később kardossá lehet fejleszteni kedvező áron.\nFelderítőt akkor érdemes kiképezni, hogy ha a városod erdőkkel vagy dombokkal van körülvéve.\nA felderítő ezen területeken nem kap mozgási büntetést.\nHa egy veterán 4X stratégiai játékos vagy, akkor a harcost vagy felderítőt egy telepes kövesse.\nA gyors terjeszkedés kritikus ilyen típusú játékokban

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = Az első körök alatt igen kevés lehetőséged lesz, de ahogy a civilizációd növekedésnek indul egyre több dologra kell majd odafigyelned.

Culture and Policies = Kultúra és Társadalompolitikák
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = Minden körben a városaid kultóra pontokat termelnek, amik összeadódnak.\nAmikor elegendő kultóra összegyűlt, akkor lehetőséged nyílik kiválasztani egy társadalompolitikát, amelyek mindegyike különböző bónuszokkal jár.
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = Minden társadalompolitika ágakra van bontva és ha egy ilyen ág teljesen adaptálva van, akkor további bónuszt adnak.
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = Minden alkalommal amikor választasz egy társadalompolitikát, és minden további épített várossal\n a költségek növekednek. Szóval bölcsen válassz!

City Expansion = Város növekedés
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = Amikor egy város elegendő kultúrát termelt, akkor növekedésnek indul a szomszédos területekre.\nNincs irányításod a fölött, hogy melyik terület irányába növekedik a város, de azon területek amelyek nyersanyagot tartalmaznak vagy nagyobb termelést hoznak, azok előnyben vannak részesítve.
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = Minden új terület megszerzéséhez több kultúrára van szükség, de általában az első városod mindig hatalmas területre fog terjeszkedni.
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = Bár a városod folyamatosan növekszik, a polgárai mindig csak a várostól számítva 3 területen belül tudnak dolgozni.\nEzt figyelembe kell venned új város elhelyezésénél.

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = Ahogy a városok növekednek területet és befolyást tekintve is, meg kell küzdened a boldogság mechanikával is, ami már nem csak város szinten lesz jelen.\nAz egész birodalmad osztoszni fog a boldogságon.\nAhogy a városaid növekednek észre fogod venni, hogy egyre nehezebb lesz boldogan tartani a birodalmad.
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = Ezeken kívül még azt is tartsd észben, hogy amíg nincs egy megfelelő kutatás befejezve, addig nem építhetsz különböző épületeket, amik növelnék a város boldogságát.\nHa a birodalmad boldogsága nulla alá csökken, akkor a városaid növekedése megáll.\nHa a birodalmad huzamosabb ideig boldogtalan (amit az interfész felső részén lévő smiley mutat)\n akkor a hadsereged harci ereje is le fog csökkeni.
 # Requires translation!
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 

Unhappiness = Boldogtalanság
 # Requires translation!
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = A boldogtalanság két fő oka: Lakosság és városok.\n  Minden városután 3 boldogtalanság jár és minden lakosság után 1
 # Requires translation!
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = Aranykorba léptél!\nAranykor pontokat minden körben kapsz a boldogságpontok után.\nAmikor Aranykorban vagy, akkor a kultúra termelés és termelékenység is 20%-al nagyobb\n és minden terület amelyik legalább egy aranyat termel, most egy arannyal többet ad.

Roads and Railroads = Utak és Vasutak
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = A városaid összekötése a fővárosoddal úttal\n aranyat fog generálni kereskedelmi útvonalak által.\nAzt vedd figyelembe, hogy minden útnak van 1 arany fenntartási költsége körönként és minden vasútnak 2 arany\n szóval gazdagságilag jobban megéri, amíg megvárod, hogy a városaid növekedjenek!

Victory Types = Győzelmi típusok
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = Mire megalapítod az első két-három városod már körül-belül úgy 100. és 150. körödnél tartasz.\nEz egy jó idő arra, hogy elgondolkodj azon miként is lehet megnyerni a játékot.
 # Requires translation!
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 
 # Requires translation!
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 

Enemy City = Ellenséges város
 # Requires translation!
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 

Luxury Resource = Luxus alapanyagok
 # Requires translation!
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 

Strategic Resource = Stratégiai alapanyagok
 # Requires translation!
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 

 # Requires translation!
The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 

After Conquering = Hódítás után
 # Requires translation!
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 
 # Requires translation!
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost, but its citizens will generate 1.5x the regular unhappiness.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 

 # Requires translation!
Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 

Injured Units = Sebesült egységek
 # Requires translation!
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 

Workers = Munkások
 # Requires translation!
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 

Siege Units = Ostrom egységek
 # Requires translation!
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 

Embarking = Vízreszállás
 # Requires translation!
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 

Idle Units = Tétlen egységek
 # Requires translation!
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units. = 

Contact Me = Kapcsolatfelvétel
 # Requires translation!
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n UnCiv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 
 # Requires translation!
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 
 # Requires translation!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 

Pillaging = fosztogatás
 # Requires translation!
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 

Experience = Tapasztalati pont
 # Requires translation!
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 

Combat = Harc
 # Requires translation!
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 

Research Agreements = Kutatási megállapodás
 # Requires translation!
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 
 # Requires translation!
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 

 # Requires translation!
Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, don't conquer other cities and can't be traded with. = 
 # Requires translation!
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 

Great People = Híres ember
 # Requires translation!
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 

Removing Terrain Features = Területi adottságok eltávolítása
 # Requires translation!
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = 

 # Requires translation!
Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 

 # Requires translation!
Keyboard = 
 # Requires translation!
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = 
 # Requires translation!
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: = 
 # Requires translation!
Space or 'N' - Next unit or turn\n'E' - Empire overview (last viewed page)\n'+', '-' - Zoom in / out\nHome - center on capital or open its city screen if already centered =

⑰: To the side of the minimap are display feature toggling buttons - tile yield, worked indicator, show/hide resources. These mirror setting on the options screen and are hidden if you deactivate the minimap. = 
 # Requires translation!
⑱: Tile information for the selected hex - current or potential yield, terrain, effects, present units, city located there and such. Where appropriate, clicking a line opens the corresponding civilopedia entry. = 
 # Requires translation!
⑲: Notifications - what happened during the last 'next turn' phase. Some are clickable to show a relevant place on the map, some even show several when you click repeatedly. = 
 # Requires translation!
⑳: The Next Turn Button - unless there are things to do, in which case the label changes to 'next unit', 'pick policy' and so on. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓐ: The overview button leads to the empire overview screen with various tabs (the last one viewed is remembered) holding vital information about the state of your civilization in the world. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓑ: The ♪Culture icon shows accumulated ♪Culture and ♪Culture needed for the next policy - in this case, the exclamation mark tells us a next policy can be enacted. Clicking is another way to the policies manager. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓒ: Your known strategic resources are displayed here with the available (usage already deducted) number - click to go to the resources overview screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓓ: Happiness/unhappiness balance and either golden age with turns left or accumulated happiness with amount needed for a golden age is shown next to the smiley. Clicking also leads to the resources overview screen as luxury resources are a way to improve happiness. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓔ: The ⍾Science icon shows the number of ⍾Science points produced per turn. Clicking leads to the technology tree. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓕ: Number of turns played with translation into calendar years. Click to see the victory overview. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓖ: The number of gold coins in your treasury and income. Clicks lead to the Stats overview screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓧ: In the center of all this - the world map! Here, the "X" marks a spot outside the map. Yes, unless the wrap option was used, Unciv worlds are flat. Don't worry, your ships won't fall off the edge. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓨ: By the way, here's how an empire border looks like - it's in the national colours of the nation owning the territory. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓩ: And this is the red targeting circle that led to the attack pane back under ⑬. = 
 # Requires translation!
What you don't see: The phone/tablet's back button will pop the question whether you wish to leave Unciv and go back to Real Life. On desktop versions, you can use the ESC key. = 

 # Requires translation!
After building a shrine, your civilization will start generating ☮Faith. = 
 # Requires translation!
When enough ☮Faith has been generated, you will be able to found a pantheon. = 
 # Requires translation!
A pantheon will provide a small bonus for your civilization that will apply to all your cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = 
 # Requires translation!
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = 
 # Requires translation!
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = 
 # Requires translation!
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = 

 # Requires translation!
Beliefs = 
 # Requires translation!
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = 
 # Requires translation!
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
Religion inside cities = 
 # Requires translation!
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = 
 # Requires translation!
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = 
 # Requires translation!
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the city screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = 
 # Requires translation!
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = 
 # Requires translation!
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = 
 # Requires translation!
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
Spreading Religion = 
 # Requires translation!
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = 
 # Requires translation!
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 
 # Requires translation!
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = 
 # Requires translation!
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = 
 # Requires translation!
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 
 # Requires translation!
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 
 # Requires translation!
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = 
 # Requires translation!
This pressure can also be seen in the city screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 
 # Requires translation!
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 
 # Requires translation!
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 
 # Requires translation!
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 

 # Requires translation!
Inquisitors = 
 # Requires translation!
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = 
 # Requires translation!
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = 
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is uneffected. = 

 # Requires translation!
The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 
 # Requires translation!
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 
 # Requires translation!
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = 

 # Requires translation!
Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 
 # Requires translation!
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = 
 # Requires translation!
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 
 # Requires translation!
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! =
