# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.

Introduction = Вступ
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = Вітайме у Unciv!\nОскільки це доволі складна гра, пропонуємо прості завдання, які допоможуть ознайомитися з грою.\nВони абсолютно необов’язкові, і ви можете самостійно вивчити гру!

Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = Ваша перша місія — це заснувати свою столицю.\nЦе насправді важливе завдання, адже саме ваша столиця буде, мабуть, найбільш процвітаючою.\nБагато ігрових бонусів стосуються лише вашої столиці, і, ймовірно, вона буде центром вашої імперії.
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to watch out for! = Як дізнатися, що це місце підходить для заснування міста?\nНа це питання складно відповісти, але шукайте ресурси розкоші та засновуйте місто біля них.\nРесурси розкоші — це клітинки, на яких є речі, такі як коштовне каміння, бавовна або шовк (позначені посмішкою поруч із значком ресурсу)\nЦі ресурси роблять вашу цивілізацію щасливішою. Ви також повинні шукати ресурси, необхідні для створення підрозділів, наприклад, залізо.\nТакож слід звернути увагу на те, що міста не можна будувати в межах 3 клітинок від існуючих міст!
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = Однак міста не мають визначеної площі, на якій вони можуть працювати — про це пізніше!\nТобто ви не повинні засновувати міста безпосередньо поруч з ресурсами.\nНаприклад, ви хочете отримати доступ до заліза — проте ресурс поруч із пустелею.\nВи не повинні селитися поруч з пустелею. Ви можете оселитися кілька клітинок подалі в більш процвітаючих місцях.\nВаше місто буде розширюватись, і врешті-решт отримає доступ до ресурсу.\nЯкщо ресурси вам потрібні негайно, ви можете селитись безпосередньо біля них – таке може траплятися час від часу, але зазвичай у вас буде достатньо часу.
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = Перший, хто вийде з вашого міста, повинен бути або Розвідник, або Воїн.\nЯ, як правило, віддаю перевагу Воїну, оскільки його можна використовувати для оборони і його можна покращити до Мечника пізніше в грі за відносно невелику суму ¤Золота.\nОднак, Розвідники можуть бути ефективнішими, якщо вам здається, що ви знаходитесь в районі густого лісу та пагорбів.\nРозвідники не отримують штрафів до ➡Переміщення на цій місцевості.\nЯкщо ви знавець жанру 4Х стратегій, то наступним після вашого першого Воїна чи Розвідника буде Поселенець.\nШвидке розширення є абсолютно необхідним у більшості ігор цього типу.

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = У вас буде не багато можливостей перші декілька ходів, але з ростом вашої цивілізації, також зростатиме кількість речей, які потребують уваги.

Culture and Policies = Культура та Політики
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = Кожний хід, ♪Культура, яку ви отримуєте від усіх своїх міст, додається до ♪Культури вашої Цивілізації.\nКоли у вас буде достатньо ♪Культури, ви зможете вибрати Соціальну політику, кожна з яких надає певний бонус.
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = Політики розподілено по гілкам, кожна з яких надає свій окремий бонус, коли всі політики в гілці прийнято.
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = Із кожною прийнятою політикою, з кожним побудованим містом,\n  вартість прийняття нових політик зростає, тому обирайте з розумом!

City Expansion = Розширення міста
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = Щойно місто накопичує достатньо ♪Культури, воно розширюється на сусідню клітинку.\nВи не можете контролювати на яку саме клітинку буде розширення, хоча в пріоритеті клітинки з ресурсами та вищим прибутком.
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = Кожна додаткова клітинка вимагає більше ♪Культури, попри це ваші перші міста згодом розширяться на досить далекі відстані.
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = Навіть якщо ваше місто буде рости вічно, ваші жителі можуть працювати лише на відстані 3-х клітинок від міського центру.\nЦе слід враховувати при розміщенні нових міст.

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = Разом з тим, як міста зростають у розмірі та чисельності, вам доведеться мати справу із механікою ⌣Щастя, яка не прив’язана до кожного окремого міста.\nВся ваша імперія має спільний рівень задоволення.\nПо мірі зростання населення ваших міст ви побачите, що підтримувати свою імперію щасливою стає дедалі складніше.
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = Окрім того, ви навіть не можете побудувати будь-які покращення міста, які збільшують щастя, поки ви не зробите відповідне дослідження.\nЯкщо ⌣Щастя вашої імперії коли-небудь опуститься нижче нуля, темп зростання ваших міст буде знижено.\nЯкщо ваша імперія стає сильно нещасною (на що вказує значок сумного обличчя у верхній частині інтерфейсу) ваші армії матимуть великий штраф до загальної ефективності бою
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = Це означає, що в Unciv дуже важко швидко розширюватися.\nЦе можливо, але нові гравці не повинні цим займатись.\nОтже, що вам робити? Розслабтеся, розвідуйте територію та покращуйте ваші землі Робітниками.\nБудуйте нові міста лише після того, як знайдете місце, яке, на вашу думку, добре підходить.

Unhappiness = Нещастя
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = Виглядає так, наче ваші громадяни нещасні!\nКоли вони нещасні, ваша цивілізація страждає від багатьох згубних наслідків, які стають все більш серйозними із зростанням рівня нещастя.
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = Нещастя має дві основні причини: населення та міста.\n  Кожне місто викликає 3 одиниці нещастя, а кожне населення — 1
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = Існує два основних шляхи як боротись із нещастям:\n  будувати споруди "щастя" для населення\n  або створенням покращень на клітинках з ресурсами розкоші у межах ваших кордонів.

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = Розпочалась Золота доба!\nБали Золотої доби накопичуються кожен хід за загальне ⌣Щастя \n  вашої цивілізації\nПід час Золотої доби приріст ♪Культури і ⚙Виробництва збільшується на 20%,\n  і кожна клітина, яка вже виробляє хоча б 1 ¤Золото, буде приносити додаткове ¤Золото.

Roads and Railroads = Дороги та Залізниці
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = Підключення ваших міст до столиці дорогами\n  призведе до отримання ¤Золота через торговий шлях.\nЗауважте, що обслуговування кожної дороги коштує 1 ¤Золото за хід,\n  а кожної залізниці - 2 ¤Золота,\n  тому варто почекати доки міста зростуть!

Victory Types = Види перемоги
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = Якщо ви побудували свої перші два-три міста, то мабуть, вже минуло 100-150 ходів.\nЗараз настав час почати думати про те, як саме ви хочете виграти, якщо ви ще цього не зробили.
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = У Unciv є чотири способи виграти:\n - Культурна перемога: завершіть 5 гілок Соціальних політик та побудуйте проект "Утопія"\n - Військова перемога: знищіть усі інші цивілізації\n - Наукова перемога: будьте першими, хто створить космічний корабель для польоту до Альфа Центаври.\n - Дипломатична перемога: Побудуйте ООН і виграйте голосування за Світового лідера.
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = Отже, підсумуємо. Для вдалої гри в Unciv ви повинні - заснувати успішне перше місто, повільно розширюватись, щоб підтримувати достатньо ⌣Щастя, та спланувати шлях до бажаної перемоги.\nОчевидно, що є ще багато нюансів, але не варто заглиблюватись у них, поки ви не навчитесь основам.

Enemy City = Вороже місто
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = Міста можна завоювати, зменшивши їх здоров’я до 1 і увійшовши в місто з підрозділом ближнього бою.\nОскільки міста відновлюються кожного ходу, найкраще атакувати підрозділами дальнього бою та захищати їх своїми підрозділами ближнього бою, поки місто не буде розгромлено!

Luxury Resource = Ресурси розкоші
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = Ресурси розкоші на вашій землі після створення відповідного покращення під’єднується до вашої торговельної мережі.\nКожен унікальний ресурс розкоші додає вашій цивілізації 5 ⌣Щастя, але додаткові ресурси того самого типу нічого не додають, тому використовуйте їх для торгівлі з іншими цивілізаціями!

Strategic Resource = Стратегічні ресурси
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = Стратегічні ресурси на вашій землі після створення відповідного покращення під’єднується до вашої торговельної мережі.\nСтратегічні ресурси дозволяють створювати підрозділи та споруджувати будівлі, для яких потрібні ці конкретні ресурси, як-от, Вершник, що потребує коней.
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = На відміну від ресурсів розкоші, кожна клітинка стратегічного ресурсу на мапі надає більше одного ресурсу.\nНа верхній панелі відображається кількість невикористаних стратегічних ресурсів, якими ви володієте.\nПовна деталізація ресурсів доступна на вкладці "Ресурси" на екрані "Огляд".

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = Місто вже не може чинити будь-який опір!\nОднак, щоб його завоювати, ви повинні увійти до міста з підрозділом ближнього бою.

After Conquering = Після захоплення
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = Після захоплення міста ви можете його звільнити, анексувати, зробити містом-маріонеткою або знищити.
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = \nВизволення міста поверне його справжньому власнику, та сильно покращить ваші дипломатичні відносини!\n\nАнексувавши місто, ви отримаєте повний контроль над ним, але його жителі створюватимуть у 2 рази більше нещастя!\nЦе можна компенсувати, побудувавши в місті суд.\n\nВи можете зробити це місто містом-маріонеткою, але тоді не зможете керувати його виробництвом.\nТаке місто не збільшуватиме вартість політик та нових технологій.\nМісто-маріонетка можна анексувати у будь-який час, але повернути йому статус маріонетки не вийде!\n\nЗнищення міста зменшуватиме його населення на 1 кожен хід, доки місто не буде знищено!\nВи не можете зруйнувати місто, яке є початковою столицею цивілізації або Святим містом релігії.

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = Ви зіткнулися з підрозділом Варварів!\nВарвари нападають на всіх без розбору, тому не дозволяйте \n  цивільним підрозділам підходити до них і стежте уважно за своїм розвідником!

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = Ви зустріли іншу цивілізацію!\nНа початку гри всі цивілізації у дружніх відносинах, і ви можете торгувати з ними,\n  але згодом вони можуть оголосити вам війну

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = Як тільки ви завершите програму "Аполлон", ви можете розпочати проектування частин космічного корабля у ваших містах(після досліджень відповідних технологій), щоб здобути Наукову перемогу!

Injured Units = Поранені підрозділи
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = Поранені підрозділи завдають менше пошкоджень, проте відновлюються після кожного ходу, якщо вони були бездіяльними.\nПідрозділи відновлюють по 10 здоров’я за хід на ворожій або нейтральній території, 20 здоров'я - усередині ваших кордонів та 25 здоров'я - у ваших містах.

Workers = Робітники
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = Робітники життєво важливі для зростання ваших міст, оскільки тільки вони можуть будувати покращення на клітинках.\nПокращення підвищують прибуток від клітинки, дозволяючи вашому місту виробляти більше і рости швидше, працюючи на тій самій кількості клітинок!

Siege Units = Облогові підрозділи
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = Облогові підрозділи надзвичайно потужні проти міст, але їх потрібно Підготувати, перед тим як вони зможуть атакувати.\nКоли ви підготуєте облоговий підрозділ, він зможе атакувати з поточної клітинки,\n  але після переміщення на іншу плитку його потрібно буде підготувати знову.

Embarking = На борту
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = Щойно певна технологія буде досліджена, ваші наземні підрозділи зможуть спускатися на воду та пересуватись по ній.\nВхід або вихід з води займає цілий хід.
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = Знаходячись на воді, ваші підрозділи беззахисні (не можуть використовувати модифікатори), мають сталу кількість †Сили Захисту, котра визначається вашою поточною епохою, тому будьте обережні!\nПідрозділи дальнього бою не можуть атакувати, сила підрозділів ближнього бою зменшена, і усі вони мають обмежене бачення.

Idle Units = Незайняті підрозділи
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you have not decided yet what an unit should do for the current turn, choose the 'Wait' command. A 'waiting' unit will be selected again at the end of the 'Next Unit' cycle, once all other units have received their orders.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units. = Якщо ви не бажаєте переміщувати підрозділ під час поточного ходу, то можете повторно натиснути кнопку "Наступний підрозділ".\nЯкщо ви не плануєте пересувати його найближчі декілька ходів, віддайте наказ Укріпитись або Спати - підрозділи у цих режимах вважаються зайнятими.\nЯкщо ви не впевнені, чим підрозділ повинен займатись протягом поточного ходу, виберіть команду "Чекати". Очікуючі підрозділи будуть повторно вибрані після того, як ви віддасте накази усім "Наступним підрозділам".\nЯкщо ви хочете вимкнути систему "Наступного підрозділу", перейдіть у Меню -> Налаштування -> у вкладці Ігролад вимкніть пункт "Перевіряти неробочі підрозділи."

Contact Me = Зв’яжіться зі мною
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n Unciv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = Привіт! Якщо ви зайшли так далеко,\n то, напевно, бачили, що гра наразі незавершена.\n Unciv задумувалась бути з відкритим вихідним кодом та безкоштовною, назавжди.\n Тобто це означає, що не буде реклами чи іншої нісенітниці.
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = Що мотивує мене продовжувати працювати над нею, \n  окрім думки "Неймовірно круто, що я можу це робити",\n  це підтримка від гравців — ви, хлопці та дівчата, найкращі!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = Кожна оцінка та відгуки, які я отримую, викликають радість на моєму обличчі =)\n  Тож зв’яжіться зі мною! Надішліть мені електронний лист, відгук, чи опис проблеми на Github\n  або поштового голуба, і давайте розбиратися, як зробити гру ще більш чудовою!\n(Контактна інформація знаходиться в Google Play)

Pillaging = Мародерство
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = Військові підрозділи можуть грабувати покращення, така дія знищить його та збільшить здоров'я підрозділу на 25 одиниць.\nКлітинку все ще можна обробляти, проте бонуси від покращень, стратегічні ресурси та ресурси розкоші - все це буде втрачено.\nРобітники можуть відремонтувати пограбовані покращення, це займає менше часу, ніж будівництво з нуля.\nЦивілізація, яка вчинила грабунок, отримає деяку суму ¤Золота.

Experience = Досвід
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = Підрозділи під час бою отримують досвід, який може бути використаний для підвищення даного підрозділу.\nПідрозділи отримують більше досвіду у Ближньому бою ніж у Дальньому, та більше під час Нападу, ніж у Захисті.
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = Підрозділи можуть отримувати від перемоги над Варварами лише до 30 одиниць досвіду — тобто до 2 підвищень. Після цього, перемоги над варварами більше не будуть приносити досвід.

Combat = Битва
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = Підрозділи та міста виснажуються в результаті бою, на який впливає ряд різних значень.\nКожний підрозділ має певне "початкове" бойове значення, яке може бути покращено за певних умов, в певних місцях та підвищеннями.
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = Підрозділи використовують "†Силу" як початкове бойове значення при атаці у ближньому бою та при обороні.\nПід час дальнього бою використовується значення "‡Сила дальнього бою".
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = Атаки дальнього бою можна здійснювати на відстані, залежно від значення "…Дальність" підрозділу.\nЯкщо атакувати ворога атакою ближнього бою, то він може дати відсіч, проте у випадку з атакою дальнього бою такого не буде.

Research Agreements = Спільні дослідження
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = Укладаючи Угоду про дослідження, ви та інша цивілізація погоджуєтесь спільно дослідити технологію.\nПісля завершення угоди ви отримаєте "одноразову суму" ⍾Науки, яка піде на користь однієї з ваших недосліджених технологій.
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = Кількість ⍾Науки, яку ви отримаєте в кінці кінців, залежить від ⍾Науки, створеної вашими містами та містами іншої цивілізації під час угоди — чим більше, тим краще!

 # Requires translation!
Defensive Pacts = 
 # Requires translation!
Defensive pacts allow you and another civ to protect one another from aggressors.\nOnce the defensive pact is signed, you will be drawn into their future defensive wars, just as they will be drawn into your future defensive wars. Declaring war on any Civ will remove all of your defensive pacts. You will have to re-sign them to use their effect. = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when signing defensive pacts because they can bring you into wars that you might not want to be in. = 
 # Requires translation!
The AI is very careful and will not accept defensive pacts with less than 80 influence. = 

Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, can't be traded with, and instead confer certain bonuses to friendly civilizations. = Не всі нації змагаються з вами за перемогу.\nМіста-держави - це нації які не мають змоги перемогти, також з ними не можна вести торгівлю, натомість вони надають певні бонуси дружнім до себе цивілізаціям.
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = Дипломатичні відносини з державами-містами визначаються Впливом — показником того, "наскільки містам-державам ви подобаєтеся".\nВплив можна збільшити шляхом атаки їхніх ворогів, визволенням їхнього міста чи просто пожертвуванням купи ¤Золота.
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = Певні бонуси надаються коли у вас є понад 30 од. Впливу.\nКоли ви маєте більше 60 од. Впливу і найбільший Вплив у цьому місті-державі серед інших цивілізацій, місто-держава буде вважати вас своїм "союзником" і ви будете отримувати додаткові бонуси та доступ до стратегічних ресурсів разом з ресурсами розкоші на їхніх землях.

Great People = Видатні особи
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = Певні споруди та спеціалісти у містах виробляють бали Видатних осіб кожного ходу.\nЄ декілька видів Видатних осіб, їхні бали накопичуються окремо.\nКількість балів за хід та накопичені бали можна подивитися на екрані "Огляд".
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = Як тільки у Вас набереться необхідна кількість балів, ви отримаєте Видатну особу відповідного напрямку!\nКожна видатна особа здатна або спорудити певне велике покращення, яке довгостроково підвищить прибуток з клітинки, на якій воно буде побудоване, або використати відповідну здібність, щоб забезпечити певний значний бонус одразу. Після використання однієї із здібностей, Видатна особа зникає.
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = Великі покращення також надають будь-які стратегічні ресурси, які під ними знаходяться, тож вам не потрібно хвилюватися, якщо під вашими великим покращенням виявляться ресурси!

Removing Terrain Features = Видалення особливостей місцевості
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = Деякі клітинки містять особливості місцевості - наприклад, заплави або ліси. Джунглі, болота та ліси можуть бути прибрані робітниками.\nВидалення особливостей не знищує ресурси на цих клітинках, і зазвичай потрібне для створення покращень для добування цих ресурсів.

Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = Природні дива, як от г. Фудзі, Гібралтарська скеля чи Великий бар’єрний риф, є унікальними, непрохідними особливостями місцевості, шедеврами матінки природи, які володіють надзвичайними особливостями, що відрізняють їх від звичайної місцевості.\nПриродні дива можуть давати величезну кількість ♪Культури, ⍾Науки, ¤Золота чи ⚙Виробництва, якщо вони обробляються біля ваших міст, тому вам краще якнайшвидше захопити їх для своєї імперії.

Keyboard = Клавіатура
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = Якщо у Вас є клавіатура, ви отримаєте доступ до певних гарячих клавіш. До речі, біля кнопок управління підрозділами та удосконалень у списках будівництва відображено відповідні їм гарячі клавіші.
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: = Гарячі клавіші на екрані світу:
Space or 'N' - Next unit or turn\n'E' - Empire overview (last viewed page)\n'+', '-' - Zoom in / out\nHome - center on capital or open its city screen if already centered = "Пробіл" або "N" — Завершити хід або Наступний підрозділ\n"E" — Огляд імперії (остання переглянута сторінка)\n"+", "-" — Збільшення / зменшення\nHome — Перейти до столиці або відкрити екран міста, якщо вже у столиці

Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = Кожна цивілізація може обрати лише одну догму, при цьому кожна з догм може бути обрана лише один раз.
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = Продовжуючи накопичувати ☮Віру ви згодом зможете заснувати релігію.

Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = Продовжуйте накопичувати ☮Віру, і з часом в одному з ваших міст народиться Видатний пророк.
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = Видатного пророка можна використати декількома способами: збудувати святе місце, заснувати релігію, поширювати релігію.
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = Засновуючи релігію, ви можете обрати дві догми. Ефект догми засновника діятиме лише на вас, тоді як ефект догми послідовника на усі міста, що сповідують цю релігію.
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = Додатково, те місто, в якому ви використали Видатного пророка, стане святим містом цієї релігії.
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = Після заснування релігії Видатні пророки продовжуватимуть народжуватись час від часу, але потребуватимуть все більшої кількості накопиченої ☮Віри.
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = Одного з цих видатних пророків можна застосувати, щоб покращити вашу релігію.
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = Це дозволить вам обрати додаткові догму послідовника та догму-посилювач, котра діятиме лише на вас.
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = Докладіть зусиль, щоб заснувати свою релігію якнайскоріше, оскільки лише близько половини гравців у грі матимуть таку можливість!

Beliefs = Догми
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = Існує чотири види догм: догми Пантеону, Засновника, Послідовника та Догми-посилювачі.
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = Догми Пантеону та Послідовника впливають на кожне місто, що сповідує вашу релігії, у той час як догми Засновника та Догми-посилювачі впливають лише на засновника релігії.

Religion inside cities = Релігія у містах
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = Місто не починає сповідувати якусь релігію одразу ж після заснування.
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = Те, яку релігію сповідує місто, залежить від тиску кожної релігії всередині міста.
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the city screen. = Кількість послідовників кожної релігії залежить від тиску, котрий ця релігія створює. Ви можете переглянути ці дані на екрані міста.
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = Ви можете перевірити кількість послідовників та тиск вашої релігії у містах, котрими ви не володієте, натиснувши на них.
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = І там, і там, ви можете натиснути на іконку релігії, щоб переглянути детальну інформацію та її ефекти.
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = Таким чином, ви можете дізнатись, яка релігія має найбільший, а яка найменший вплив на жителів.
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = Місто сповідуватиме релігію більшості населення, і лише тоді отримає ефекти від догм Послідовника та Пантеону цієї релігії.

Spreading Religion = Поширення релігії
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = Поширення відбувається природно, але може бути прискорене місіонерами або Видатними пророками.
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = Місіонерів можна придбати в містах, які сповідують основну релігію, і вони приймуть релігію цього міста.
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = Тому звертайте увагу на те, де ви купуєте їх! Якщо інша цивілізація навернула одне з ваших міст до своєї релігії, куплені там місіонери будуть слідувати їхній релігії.
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = Видатні пророки завжди сповідують саме вашу релігію, навіть якщо їх купують у містах з іншою релігією, але захоплені видатні пророки зберігають свою початкову релігію.
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = І Видатний пророк, і місіонер, здатні поширювати релігію в міста, коли вони знаходяться в їхніх межах, навіть у містах інших цивілізацій.
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = Ці підрозділи можуть переміщуватись на території цивілізацій, з котрими у вас не підписано договір про відкриті кордони!
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = Але будьте уважними, місіонери втрачатимуть 250 релігійної сили за кожен хід, завершений на чужій території.
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = Це зменшує їхню ефективність у поширенні релігії, і якщо їхня релігійна сила сягає 0, вони втрачають ☮Віру та зникають.
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = Коли ви поширюєте релігію, релігійна потужність додається до тиску цієї релігії.
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = Міста також пасивно посилюють тиск своєї основної релігії на сусідні міста.
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = Кожне місто збільшує тиск своєї релігії на +6 в усіх містах в радіусі 10 клітинок, проте точна кількість залежить від швидкості гри.
This pressure can also be seen in the city screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = Цей тиск можна побачити на екрані міста. Значення дозволяє зрозуміти, як змінюватиметься релігійний склад населення у ваших містах, якщо ви нічого не робитимете.
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = Святі міста забезпечують +30 тиску заснованої там релігії на себе, що ускладнює ефективне навернення святого міста.
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = Наостанок, перш ніж заснувати релігію, нові міста, які ви оселите, починатимуть із тиском 200 для вашого пантеону.
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = Таким чином, усі ваші міста почнуть слідувати вашому пантеону, якщо ви ще не заснували релігію.

Inquisitors = Інквізішты
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = Інквізитори є останньою релігійною одиницею, і їхня сила - усунення інших релігій.
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = Вони можуть усунути всі інші релігії з одного з ваших власних міст, прибравши будь-який накопичений тиск.
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = Видатні пророки також мають цю здібність і усувають всі інші релігії в місті, коли поширюють свою релігію.
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = Часто це призводить до того, що місто негайно приймає їхню релігію
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is uneffected. = Крім того, коли інквізитор розміщений у центрі міста або безпосередньо біля нього, підрозділи інших релігій не можуть поширювати там свою ☮Віру, хоча це не впливає на природне поширення.

The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = Унікальна здібність Майя, 'Довгий Рахунок', має додатковий ефект:
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = Щойно активована, відображення року у грі буде у форматі календаря Майя.
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = Майя вимірювали час днями від того, що ми б назвали 11 серпня 3114 року до нашої ери. Один день називається Кін, 20 днів це Вінал, 18 Віналів це Тун, 20 Тунів складають Катун, а 20 Катунів - Бактун, 20 Бактунів - це Піктун, і так далі.
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = Unciv відображає лише ය Бактуни, ඹ Катуни та ම Туни (зліва направо) оскільки цього достатньо, щоб приблизно вимірювати кількість років по григоріанському календарю. Числа майя досить очевидні для розуміння. Розважайтеся розшифровуючи їх!

Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = Ваші міста періодично будуть потребувати різні товари розкоші, щоб задовольнити своє прагнення до нового.
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = Якщо ви зможете отримати необхідну розкіш торгівлею, розширенням чи завоюванням, місто буде святкувати День Любові до Короля протягом 20⏳ ходів.
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = Протягом святкування Дня Любові до Короля, місто зростає на 25% швидше.
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = Це означає, що розвідка та торгівля - важливі для росту ваших міст!

Air Sweeps = Повітряні зачистки
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = Винищувачі можуть виконувати повітряні зачистки над обраною клітинкою у спробі виявити та знищити повітряні, морські, або сухопутні ворожі засоби перехоплення, спроможні захищати ту клітинку.
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = Хоч ця дія і забирає одну можливість напасти, натомість вона дозволяє убезпечити інші ваші повітряні підрозділи, зокрема бомбардувальники.
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = Ваш підрозділ завжди буде робити перехоплення, якщо може досягти цільової клітинки, навіть якщо перехоплюючий підрозділ може промахнутись.
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = Якщо перехоплювачем є не повітряний підрозділ (тобто сухопутний або морський), то підрозділ, який виконує повітряну зачистку, та підрозділ-перехоплювач не зазнають жодних пошкоджень!
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = Якщо перехоплювач є повітряним підрозділом, два підрозділи завдадуть шкоди один одному в бою, без бонусів за перехоплення. І лише атакуючий підрозділ, який виконує повітряну зачистку, отримує бонуси сили для повітряної зачистки.

City Tile Blockade = Блокада клітинки міста
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = Одна з ваших клітинок заблокована ворогом: коли ворожий підрозділ знаходиться на вашій клітинці, клітинка нічого не буде виробляти та не може бути оброблена містом цього ходу. Місто перенесе населення з заблокованої клітинки автоматично.
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = Ворожі військові підрозділи блокують клітинки на яких, вони знаходяться. Ворожі морські підрозділи додатково блокують і прилеглі морські клітинки. Щоб захистити вашу клітинку від блокади, розташуйте дружній військовий підрозділ на ній, або вибийте окупантів.

City Blockade = Блокада міста
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = Одне з ваших міст під морською блокадою! Коли усі прилеглі морські клітинки прибережного міста заблоковані - місто втрачає з'єднання через гавань до усіх інших міст, включно зі столицею. Забезпечте деблокаду міст, випускаючи воєнні морські підрозділи, щоб відбити окупантів.

Double-click the image to reset the binding to default. = Двічі клацніть зображення, щоб скинути призначення за замовчуванням.
Bindings mapped to their default keys are displayed in gray, those reassigned by you in white. = Налаштування за замовчуванням відображаються сірим кольором, а перепризначені вами - білим.
Conflicting assignments are marked red. Conflicts can exist across categories, like World Screen / Unit Actions. Note that at the moment, the game does not prevent saving conflicting assignments, though the result may be unexpected. = Конфліктні призначення підсвічені червоним. Конфлікти можуть існувати через категорії, як то Світовий екран / Дії підрозділу. Зверніть увагу, що гра не запобігає збереженню конфліктних призначень, тому результат може бути непередбачуваним.
For discussion about missing entries, see the linked github issue. = Для обговорення відсутніх призначень див. відповідну тему на github.

Welcome to the Civilopedia! = Ласкаво просимо до Цивілопедії!

What information can I find = Яку інформацію я можу знайти
The data shown is not dependent on your current game's situation, e.g. bonuses for the nation you are playing or difficulty modifiers will not affect the numbers. = Наведені дані не залежать від поточної ситуації у вашій грі, наприклад, бонуси для нації, за яку ви граєте, або модифікатори складності не впливають на значення.
However, it will reflect the mods you are playing! The combination of base ruleset and extension mods you select define the rules of a game, what objects exist and how they interact, and the Civilopedia mirrors these rules. = Однак, тут будуть відображені модифікації, в які ви граєте! Комбінація базового набору правил і вибраних вами доповнень визначає правила гри, які об'єкти існують і як вони взаємодіють, а Цивілопедія відображає ці правила.
