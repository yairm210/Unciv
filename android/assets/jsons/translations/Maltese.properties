# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.

Hellenic League = 
Great King Alexander, leader of the mighty Greek nation, you are truly blessed by the gods. In 480 BC, quarrelsome city-states such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, found a way to join their forces, allowing Greece to defeat the mighty Persia in the 5th century BC, both on land and sea. Following their example, you lead a Greek coalition and finally struck down the Persian Empire in 331 BC. You conquered almost all the known world, and from Europe to Africa to India, you built an empire unmatched by any before it. =

Oh. It's you? = 
Art of War = 
Heaven itself bends before your beauty, Empress Wu Zetian, ruler of eternal China! You lead one of the oldest and greatest civilization of humanity. In your time, China stood at the forefront of science and technology, bringing the world such contributions as gunpowder, the printing press, and the world of Confucius, and this, long before the rest of the world was mature enough to make the same discoveries! =

Long live to Your Highness, Queen Elizabeth Gloriana, leader and protector of the glorious England! Through history, enduring many invasions, England strengthened its will, playing smartly with diplomacy, cunning, and military power, to eventually rose as one of the most dominant Empires the world has ever known. Their matchless navy, brilliant scientists and artists, and powerful merchants, have shaped the known world for centuries. =

Vive Napoleon I, First Consul and Emperor of France! After the glorious Revolution which suppressed the centuries-old monarchy, the French nation stood at the heart of Europe as a Republic, and intended to export its ideals to the entire European continent, either by diplomacy or war. The French Capital Paris was more than ever the world center of Culture, Arts, and Letters. With its Great Army, reputed as one of the greatest in the History, France fought gloriously all surrounding enemies, but eventually fell against the coalition of other European powers. =

Hail to Imperial Majesty Catherine, Empress of all Russians. Living in the largest country in the world, from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Baltic Sea in the west, your people endured wars, droughts, and many disasters, imbuing the Russian society with heroism and tenacity, and producing artists and scientists among the best in the world.

I offer this, for your consideration. = 
Hail. = 
What do you want? = 
The Glory of Rome = 
Ave Caesar Augustus, Emperor of Rome and Dominus of the Roman Empire! Your empire was the most powerful and feared of all in Western civilization. The Roman people crafted so brilliantly its culture, law, art, and warfare, that no one could contest the supremacy of Rome. Force and Honor led to glorious conquests, a domination of all the lands from Spain in the west to Syria in the east, even reaching the remote barbarian lands of England and Germany. Roman art and architecture have been praised for millenia and have been envied by all lesser civilizations who have followed. = 
O glorious Imperator, your people celebrate you and ask for the glory of Rome! In these times of darkness, the Pax Romana will be a beacon of light for all! Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

Blessings of the Great God be upon you, O great caliph Harun al-Rashid, leader of the mighty Arabian people! The Muslim Empire, the Caliphate, born from chaos after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, intended to apply the rule of God to all Earth. And by the will of God, the caliphate reached its full power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia, to even surpass the Great Roman Empire. The arts and sciences were a holy gift of Arabia during the Middle Ages, as the infidel lands of Europe delved deep into ignorance and chaos. Lasting for six hundred years, the Caliphate finally fell before the Mongols, the plague of the civilized world. = 
Great Caliph Harun al Rashid, all Arabian people long for greatness! Arabia must be once again the land of arts and knowledge, which under the radiant law of God, will fear no enemy! Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

President Washington, we salute you and the proud American civilization! Freed from the British dominion in the 18th century, then cleansed and reborn after a terrible civil war, the United States nation was ready to play its great role in the 20th century. At the height of its power, triumphant after two terrible world wars, United States of America, a land of immigration, opportunities, optimism and determination, has risen above all other weakening nations, unable to equal such power. =

Oh, it's you... = 
Bushido = 
Lord Oda Nobunaga, ruler of Japan, the land of the Rising Sun is at your command! Through history, Japanese people lived and died with honor, proud of their rich culture of arts and letters. Years of bloody civil wars, invasions of foreign powers, wealth but also great poverty, have never altered the strong will of the Rising Sun island, as the Bushido spirit has imbued the fields of battle and the Japanese society for millenia. At the end of the 19th century, under foreign influence, your people took the path of modernity, and in a few decades, made of Japan a land of technological innovation and powerful industry, with which only few nations can compete. =

Population Growth = 
Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you! India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land. Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty. For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders. In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place. In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority. After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history! = 
Gandhi, your people ask again to be led on the path of freedom. Under protection of Ganesha and Surya, can India accomplish its great potential? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

It would be in your best interest, to carefully consider this proposal. =

So, out with it! = 
Furor Teutonicus = 
All hail to Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of Germany and its empire! During the ancient era, Germany was a land fragmented in several tribes but already showed great promise as the Roman Empire itself struggled to bend the Germans to its will. Germany, as one nation, was slowly built on the ruins of the Holy Roman Empire, and waited 1871 to be finally unified after the glorious victory on France and Napoleon III. The German people are creative, intelligent, industrious and proven to be talented warriors through history. Despite great catastrophes and failures in the first half of the 20th century, Germany can always rely on its people will and strength to be among the greatest and powerful nations in the world. =

Barbary Corsairs = 
O Great Sultan Suleiman, may the God bless you! You are revered for your power, wealth and generosity, and you truly deserves to be called the 'Magnificent'! The Ottoman Empire was born in Bithynia, starting as a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century, then expanded to west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your people vanquished the empire of Byzantium, annexing Turkey and the Balkans, and smartly assimilating all wonders and knowledge of the Byzantine civilization. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans added Constantinople to their empire, establishing a strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. The Empire would continue to expand for centuries reaching North Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height, but brutally disappeared in the chaos of the first world war, in early 20th century. =

Greetings to you, King Sejong the Great, heir of the Choson Dynasty! Prosperity and benevolence towards the common man are the principles of your reign, and made of you the most beloved Korean king. You always aimed to provide a fair and equal society for all your people, and also to favor knowledge and technological discoveries. Your wisdom and intelligence imbued all the Korean society, and the scholars of the Jade Hall developed Korea's first written language, Hangul, sharing further literature and science to the people after centuries of darkness. =

The Great Warpath = 
Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario since the ancient ages, on a land that will be later known as New York city. Long ago, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida became one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. Although not having a written language, the wise Iroquois created the Great Law of Peace, which can be considered the first established constitution.

Great King Darius of Persia, the heaven casts its light upon you! Persian people are strong and wise, as their leader. In old ages, the great Persian king Cyrus fought back the mighty Median empire and finally destroyed the Medes in 550 BC. Cunning diplomacy and military achievements helped then to conquer the wealthy Lydia and the powerful Babylon, Cyrus' son conquering the eternal Egypt some years later. At the height of its power, the Persian Empire reached the shores of Macedonia, at the very door of the upstart Greek city-states. Persia would have prospered for centuries if Alexander of Macedon hadn't brutally destroyed the great empire in one violent strike. = 
King Darius, the people of Persia await, longing for its past glory and power! Persia of the Immortals must reborn, to punish its foes and rebuild the gleaming Persepolis! Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

Aloha to Kamehameha the Great, who the heavens allowed to unite your people! O great King, under your reign, the Big Island of Hawai'i became one in 1791 AD, and many other islands joined your vision of union in 1810. As the first King of Hawai'i, law and taxation systems were stabilized, and you promoted the Kanawai Mamalahoe, an edict to protect civilian people in times of war. Unification and sovereignty of all the islands continued thanks to your fair laws and deeds, even after you joined your ancestors in paradise in 1819. =

Welcome. = 
Father Governs Children = 
O Great King Ramkhamhaeng, the Siamese people obey you with respect and fear! The beautiful and mysterious land of Siam is an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia, which was besieged by many foes, plagued by bloody war and great poverty, but eventually the smart and loyal Siamese people have endured and triumphed. Siam was a part of the Khmer Empire until the 13th century AD, before its brave people took arms and led a revolution to form the small Sukhothai kingdom. After many battles and diplomacy prowess, this tiny kingdom became a mighty empire, which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century. = 
Wise and powerful King Ramkhamhaeng, your people want to revive these days of glory! Can you make a new dawn break on Siam? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

Seven Cities of Gold = 
Holy Isabella, envoy of God, Great Queen of Castille and León, your people celebrate you! Spain is a beautiful and ancient country, a link between Europe and Africa, one shore on the Mediterranean and the other on the mighty Atlantic Ocean. The Spanish culture had taken the best of the Christian and Muslim worlds, and was ready to dominate the world for centuries. Powerful Spanish military fleets and brave explorers found and conquered much of the New World. Exploiting a whole new continent and its riches, Spain reached a state of power few could compete with for hundreds of years. = 
O splendid and virtuous Isabella! By the will of the heavens, will Spain reborn to achieve its holy destiny and become a new El Dorado? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

I am Askia of the Songhai. We are a fair people - but those who cross us will find only destruction. You would do well to avoid repeating the mistakes others have made in the past. = 
Can I interest you in this deal? = 
River Warlord = 
Askia, leader of the Songhai people and greatest of all, may God watch your path towards glory! Songhai was under the rule of the mighty West African state of Mali until the middle of the 14th century. Great King Sunni Ali Ber fought for independance, and showed to all Songhai's power, by conquering territories and repelling many foes who sought to destroy the rising kingdom. Ultimately, conquest of the wealthy cities of Timbuktu and Jenne made Songhai an empire with enough economic power to survive for a century, until the empire bowed down before foes with advanced technology - muskets against spearmen. = 
King Askia, your people know there's still hope, that the hour of revenge is coming. Give them wealth and power, give them mighty weapons of iron and fire, to destroy any foe, for Songhai to revive! Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

I am not always this generous, but we hope you take this rare opportunity we give you. = 
So what now? = 
Mongol Terror = 
O great Temuujin, immortal leader of the mighty Mongol Empire! Your name alone was enough to make cities crumble, and the sound of the mighty Mongol cavalry to make your enemies flee! O Great Khan! Once Northern Asia united into a mighty people, producing one of the greatest armies the world has ever known, your skillful mounted archers conquered in only a few years, most of China, Eastern Asia, and even reached the gates of Europe at the West. With cunning diplomacy and brilliant warfare, you swept your enemies one after another, creating the greatest empire ever seen, reducing Roman or Greek conquests to minor achievements. = 
Divine Temuujin, battles and conquests run through the veins of the Mongols. Are you ready to shatter the will of your enemies? Will your cavalry ride in the steppes once again and strike as lightning and thunder? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

O divine Montezuma, your people welcome you! May your magnificence inspire all living things! The mighty Aztecs were nomads until the 12th century, when they choose to settle in the mesa central, which would later be called Mexico. Wars were frequent with other tribes to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zampango. In some 200 years, double-sided alliances and martial prowess made of the Aztecs the dominant power in the Central American basin, forming a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea. Alas, the empire fell under the assault of foreign devils - the Spaniards and many curses they brought with them! Wars between tribes and weaponry of doom used by the invaders made the great Aztec civilization crumble in only a few decades. =

They won many wars against powerful enemies, relentlessly crushing any army that dared oppose them, and forged a mighty empire stretching from Ecuador to Chile, the greatest ever seen in pre-Columbian America. Not just undaunted soldiers, Inca people were accomplished builders and artists, their magnificient and unequalled culture still fascinating the world today. =

In 983 AD, you successfully repelled several waves of German settlers trying to colonize your land, and then always kept your kingdom free from any foreign pressure. = 
As a true Viking, who knows not fear, time has come to unleash mighty armies of Northsmen to bring despair upon your enemies! By the will of the Gods, it will be either a glorious triumph or a sumptuous feast in the Valhalla! Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

Do you know who you're dealing with? = 
You are in the presence of Attila, scourge of Rome. Do not let hubris be your downfall as well. = 
This is better than you deserve, but let it not be said that I am an unfair man. = 
Good day to you. = 
Scourge of God = 
Great Attila, mighty warrior and leader of the Hunnic empire, your men bow down before you. During the 5th century, you and your brother Bleda have conquered many lands, forged a mighty empire and commanded the most powerful and frightening force of antiquity. You inspired fear to the Roman Emperors themselves, who called you 'Flagellum Dei', the 'Scourge of God', as you took kingdom after kingdom in the Balkans, invaded Eastern Roman Empire, into Gaul and Northern Italy, and planned to conquer Rome itself. Your empire didn't survive long after your death, but your name and your legend have, for millenia to come. =

Once again, greetings. = 
Dutch East India Company = 
Greetings to the wise and brave Prince William of Orange, who freed the Netherlands and gave strength to the Dutch people. In 1568, you led a rebellion against Spanish dominion, to gain freedom for your people, and therefore starting the Eighty Years' War. Your actions were all aimed to create one of Europe's first modern republics, the Seven United Provinces. The rebellion was the meaning of your very life and death, as it was also the cause of your assassination in 1584. But your death has given even more pride and courage to your people, to fight for liberty against any oppressors. Carved in history as the 'Father of the Fatherland', your name is a symbol of Dutch independence for eternity. = 
Brave Prince, your people ask for your wisdom to gain its freedom once more, and to illuminate the world with progressive and modern ideas. Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

Nobel Prize = 
All hail Great King Gustavus Adolphus, founder of the Swedish Empire, and one of the most famous military tacticians. In the early 17th century, Sweden emerged as a great power in Europe under your reign, thanks to your wisdom, both in diplomacy and warfare. As king, you decided to reform Swedish laws to bring economic stability and prosperity to your people. Your allies, and also your enemies, called you the 'Lion of the North', witnessing your modern vision of warfare, and the prowess of your armies on the battlefield. As you triumphed in the Thirty Years' War, your name will be forever remembered as one of history's greatest generals. =

Noble and pious Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, the people revere your grace. After the death of your father King Charles VI, you inherited the throne of Austria during difficult economic and military times. But you used your wisdom and unflinching determination to fend off your foes and resolve any obstacles to stability and prosperity. With your husband Francis Stephen at your side as co-ruler, you assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reign, you reformed Austria in several domains, as you gifted it with a powerful army, a stable economic model, and an improved educational system. =

Greetings to you, revered Queen Dido, ruler of the legendary kingdom of Carthage. The great poet Virgil related your great history, how your husband Acerbas was murdered by your own brother, King Pygmalion of Tyre, to steal the treasures of your family that were rightfully yours. But you endured his pressure until you and your compatriots decided to flee and sail for new lands. The gods led you to the shores of North Africa, and with cunning diplomacy, you expanded the territory of your new home, and laid the basis for the future kingdom of Carthage. = 
Clever and proud Dido, the storm is coming and your people look for a shelter under your wise and powerful protection. Can you create a new and radiant Carthage able to cleave the darkness? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =

Patriarchate of Constantinople = 
Magnificent Empress Theodora, beloved of Byzantium and of Rome, your people salute you! With your beauty and intelligence, you rose up from actress and courtesan to the rank of the most powerful woman in the Roman Empire, as wife of Justinian I. In the late 520's AD, you helped your husband engage in spiritual and legal reforms, promugalting numerous laws to improve women's status and treatment in the empire. You also made of Constantinople the jewel of the Eastern Roman Empire with the restoration and construction of many aqueducts, bridges, and churches, its beauty culminating with the creation of the Hagia Sophia, one of the most splendid pieces of architecture in the world. =

May glory and honor always be upon you, Warrior Queen! In a time dominated by men, you successfully claimed the throne and the power, but also valiantly defied the mighty Roman Empire. Punished and humiliated by the hand of the Roman bloody invaders, you united your people and led a terrible revolt, to seek revenge. Many legions fell under your fierce attacks and you burned the city of London with your anger. While the Romans still kept ownership of your land after your final defeat, your actions nonetheless showed Rome that this land could never be fully conquered, making Nero himself consider to withdraw all troops and leaving Britain forever. =

Introduction = 
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 

Welcome to Unciv! = 
Because this is a complex game, there are some tutorials to help familiarize you with it. These can be disbaled in the Options -> Display menu, but please hang on if you're new here! = 
Your first mission is to found your capital city. This is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous. Many game bonuses apply only to your capital city, and it will be the center of your empire. = 
How do you know a city location is appropriate? Luckily, the game has already chosen a good location for you. You can settle in this place, or maybe move a turn to found on a Hill (for Production and defence) or next to a Mountain (to gain access to the Observatory building later on). = 
You'll likely want more cities later on. For these cities, you must go and find a good place. Looking for and founding on or near Luxury resources is a good rule of thumb. = 
Luxury resources are tiles that have things like Gems, Cotton, or Silk (indicated by a yellow background of the resource icon). These resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as Iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to keep in mind! = 
Cities will house Citizens, which can work tiles up to 3 tiles away from the city. This means you don’t have to settle cities right on or next to good tiles. Let’s say, for example, that you want access to some Iron – but the resource is in a desert area. You don’t have to settle your city in the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands. Your city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource. You only need to settle right on top of resources if you need them immediately. = 
The first thing coming out of your city depends on the strategy you want to follow, but the 'classic' build order is to build first two Scouts, then a Shrine, and three Settlers, and adopt Tradition, to explore the map quickly (Scouts ignore terrain cost), and to get an early Pantheon (if you're playing with religion enabled). = 
But feel free to experiment with your own build orders! = 

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 

Culture and Policies = 
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 

City Expansion = 
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 

Food is the resource fundamental to your Cities', and as a result Nation's, population and health. = 
Every Citizen in each City consumes Food per turn. Any left over is considered Growth and is stored in the City Center. Once enough accumulates, the City Grows and a new Citizen is added. = 
Initially your main source of Food is the City Center itself and working a surrounding tile with a Citizen. You can increase how much is generated by gaining more Citizens to work more tiles, improving the tiles so that they yield more Food, and eventually Buildings and Policies. = 
Since a city's number of Citizens, or Population, determines how many tiles a City can work, Food is often the most important Resource. = 

Production is the resource that lets a City Center build new things. = 
This can be new Buildings that are added to the City Center, or new Units that can go out across the World Map to advance your Nation's goals. = 
Everything you can build has a Production Cost. Every turn each City generates a certain amount of Production and puts it towards whatever is at the top of the Build Queue. Once the total cost is collected, the Building or Unit is built! = 
Any excess Production after something is built is overflowed to the next thing the City builds. Up to it's total Production Cost. = 
Since this determines how quickly you can build more stuff, your Nation's Production Capacity is crucial to it's advancement and survival. = 

⍾Science is the resource that unlocks new and exciting Technologies for your Nation. = 
Once you've Founded your Capital, you'll be prompted to Pick a Technology to Research. = 
Every Technology costs an amount of ⍾Science. Every turn the ⍾Science your Nation produces is paid towards Researching your chosen Technology. = 
Once a Technology has it's cost fully paid, you unlock the benefits for your Nation! This could be new Units, Buildings, or other advantages. Any surplus will overflow into the next Technology you pick to Research. = 
Researching a Technology in the next Era will advance you into that Era and trigger a notification to other Nations about how amazing you are! = 
Since new Technologies tend to give access to better Units, Buildings, and even unlock powerful new Policies, staying ahead of the competition is one of the best ways to secure your Victory! = 

Ah Gold. The Universal Medium of Exchange. Everyone loves Gold! They say it can't buy Happiness, but nuclear submarines are almost as good. = 
You can earn more Gold from Tiles, Resources, Improvements, and eventually Buildings, Specialists, and Trade Routes. Ancient Ruins, meeting new City-States, and Pillaging are also great sources of Gold. During a Golden Age every Tile that already yields Gold will yield an additional Gold! = 
Gold is how you pay for Building Maintenance, Transportation Upkeep, and Unit Upkeep. If you run out of Gold, first you'll receive penalties to your ⍾Science production, then eventually your Units will start Disbanding as you can't pay their upkeep. = 
Gold can be used to Buy Buildings and Units, helping bring up a new City or quickly build an Army. It can also buy Tiles to add to your City. It's also used to Upgrade your units from their older, obsolete forms to new, stronger versions. And investing it into a Research Agreement is a great way to convert it into ⍾Science. = 
Gold is also very valuable in Diplomacy. You can directly Gift Gold to City-States to gain their favor. Use it to balance a Trade Deal with other Nations. Or demand every last drop after a successful war and your enemy sues for peace. = 
Ironically, some may consider Gold to be one of the less important Resources. But it's flexible nature and importance to keep your Nation running makes it a precious thing to pay attention to. After all, everyone loves Gold. = 
Not to be confused with the Resource of the same name, Gold Ore =

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 

Unhappiness = 
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 

Roads and Railroads = 
Roads reduce the Movement Points required to move between two tiles connected by Roads. = 
Railroads improve this reduction even more! = 
This greatly improves the speed you can get Units around the map. = 
Until you research the technology that removes it, Roads do not cross Rivers = 
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. = 
However, since each Road and Railroad have a Maintenance Cost, it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow and only place where needed. = 

Trade Route = 
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. You earn more Gold the more Population the City and your Capital has. = 
Note that each road costs 1 Gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 Gold, so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 
Railroads connecting a city to the Capital also provide a 25% Production Boost to the City, but not the Capital. = 
Trade Routes are also connected over Water via certain buildings like the Harbor. As long as there is a chain that can reach the Capital, there's a Trade Route. Look for this symbol in Yellow below the City Name to mean you have an active Trade Route to your Capital. = 
Trade Routes can get broken either by Blockades or by Removing/Pillaging the connecting Road/Railroad chain. = 
See also City Blockade = 

Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 

Enemy City = 
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 

Luxury Resource = 
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 

Strategic Resource = 
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 

After Conquering = 
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = 

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 

Injured Units = 
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 

Workers = 
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 

Siege Units = 
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 

Embarking = 
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 

Idle Units = 
Clicking 'Next unit' moves to the next idle unit in the queue (as listed in Overview -> Units). After issuing an order to an unit, if 'Auto Unit Cycle' in Options -> Gameplay is enabled, you will automatically select the next idle unit. = 
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again, or command the unit to 'Skip turn'. = 
If you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Options -> Gameplay -> Check for idle units. = 
If you'd rather 'Next unit' cycle the units and not mark them as Done, you can change it in the Options -> Gameplay menu. = 
You can also cycle through the idle units using the left and right triangles on the Unit Table in the lower left of the screen. Or by default using the Cycle button next to the 'Next Unit' button. = 

Contact Me = 
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n Unciv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 

Pillaging = 
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 

Experience = 
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 

Combat = 
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 

Embassies = 
Establishing an embassy in other players' Capital city shows the location of their Capital, likewise other players who establish an embassy in your Capital can see location of your Capital. = 
Embassies thus allow Spies to be placed in another players' Capital City if Espionage is enabled. = 
Mutual embassies are required to allow trading open borders and to sign Research Agreement and Defensive Pact. = 
Declaring war on another player or denouncing them will remove embassies from both players' Capitals. You will have to re-establish them to use their effect. = 
Re-establishing an embasy after denounciation from either side becomes available next turn, while re-establishing them when at war requires peacy treaty. = 
Be cautious when accepting embassy from other players because they can spy on your capital, or worse may start planning to attack you. = 
Embassies are available using the Gods and Kings ruleset. = 

Open Borders from other player and vice versa allow units to freely pass trough their territoy. = 
They also let Missionaries to enter other players' territory without suffering attrition. = 
Open Borders expire depending on game speed and are canceled upon Declaration of War, the closure however takes effect only after war ends and need to be traded again. = 
You gain diplomatic boost with other AI player if you both have Open Borders to each other = 
Be cautious when giving Open Borders because other player may settle a City near your lands in an area you are planning to use, they may also use your territory to attack your friends or City State allies. = 
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Open Borders can be traded. = 
See also: Embassies = 

Research Agreements = 
In Research Agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of ⍾Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 
Note that before you can invest in a research agreement, you must have a Declaraction of Friendship, both Nations need the required Technology, and both Nations need enough Gold on hand for the agreement. = 
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Research Agreement can be signed. = 

Defensive Pacts = 
Defensive pacts allow you and another civ to protect one another from aggressors.\nOnce the defensive pact is signed, you will be drawn into their future defensive wars, just as they will be drawn into your future defensive wars. Declaring war on any Civ will remove all of your defensive pacts. You will have to re-sign them to use their effect. = 
Be cautious when signing defensive pacts because they can bring you into wars that you might not want to be in. = 
The AI is very careful and will not accept defensive pacts with less than 80 influence. = 
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Defensive Pact can be signed. = 

Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, can't be traded with, and instead confer certain bonuses to friendly civilizations. = 
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 

While working the land is good, eventually your Citizens will want to Specialize. = 
Certain Buildings will also provide Specialist Slots. These slots will show up in the Citizen Management within the City Screen under Specialists. Each slot can be filled with a Citizen which will then become a Specialist. = 
Each Specialist will generate a certain amount of yield as indicated to the right of the available slots. = 
While these are a great way to specialize the yield production of a City outside of the surrounding Tile Yields, Specialists have an additional value. Each one also generates Great Person Points each turn. With enough of them, a new Great Person will join your Nation. = 
See also Great People = 

Great People = 
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = 
Alternatively, the Great Person points breakdown per city can be viewed in each City Screen (see UI Tips article). = 
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 
See also Specialists = 

Removing Terrain Features = 
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = 

Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, ⍾Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 

Keyboard = 
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = 
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: = 
Space or 'N' - Next unit or turn\n'E' - Empire overview (last viewed page)\n'+', '-' - Zoom in / out\nHome - center on capital or open its City Screen if already centered = 
F1 - Open Civilopedia\nF2 - Empire overview Trades\nF3 - Empire overview Units\nF4 - Empire overview Diplomacy\nF5 - Social policies\nF6 - Technologies\nF7 - Empire overview Cities\nF8 - Victory Progress\nF9 - Empire overview Stats\nF10 - Empire overview Resources\nF11 - Quicksave\nF12 - Quickload = 
Ctrl-R - Toggle tile resource display\nCtrl-Y - Toggle tile yield display\nCtrl-O - Game options\nCtrl-S - Save game\nCtrl-L - Load game\nCtrl-U - Toggle UI (World Screen only) = 
All of these can be reassigned. = 

This is where you spend most of your time playing Unciv. See the world, control your units, access other screens from here. = 
①: The menu button - civilopedia, save, load, options... = 
②: The player/nation whose turn it is - click for diplomacy overview. = 
③: The Technology Button - shows the tech tree which allows viewing or researching technologies. = 
④: The Social Policies Button - shows enacted and selectable policies, and with enough culture points you can enact new ones. = 
⑤: The Diplomacy Button - shows the diplomacy manager where you can talk to other civilizations. = 
⑥: Unit Action Buttons - while a unit is selected its possible actions appear here. = 
⑦: The unit/city info pane - shows information about a selected unit or city. = 
⑧: The name (and unit icon) of the selected unit or city, with current health if wounded. Clicking a unit name or icon will open its civilopedia entry. = 
⑨: The arrow buttons allow jumping to the next/previous idle unit. = 
⑩: For a selected unit, its promotions appear here, and clicking leads to the promotions screen for that unit. = 
⑪: Remaining/per turn movement points, strength and experience / XP needed for promotion. For cities, you get its combat strength. = 
⑫: This button closes the selected unit/city info pane. = 
⑬: This pane appears when you order a unit to attack an enemy. On top are attacker and defender with their respective base strengths. = 
⑭: Below that are strength bonuses or penalties and health bars projecting before / after the attack. = 
⑮: The Attack Button - let blood flow! = 
⑯: The minimap shows an overview over the world, with known cities, terrain and fog of war. Clicking will position the main map. = 
⑰: To the side of the minimap are display feature toggling buttons - tile yield, worked indicator, show/hide resources. These mirror setting on the options screen and are hidden if you deactivate the minimap. = 
⑱: Tile information for the selected hex - current or potential yield, terrain, effects, present units, city located there and such. Where appropriate, clicking a line opens the corresponding civilopedia entry. = 
⑲: Notifications - what happened during the last 'next turn' phase. Some are clickable to show a relevant place on the map, some even show several when you click repeatedly. = 
⑳: The Next Turn Button - unless there are things to do, in which case the label changes to 'next unit', 'pick policy' and so on. = 
㉑: The Multiplayer Button - Here you can easily check your active multiplayer games. = 
ⓐ: The overview button leads to the empire overview screen with various tabs (the last one viewed is remembered) holding vital information about the state of your civilization in the world. = 
ⓑ: The ♪Culture icon shows accumulated ♪Culture and ♪Culture needed for the next policy - in this case, the exclamation mark tells us a next policy can be enacted. Clicking is another way to the policies manager. = 
ⓒ: Your known strategic resources are displayed here with the available (usage already deducted) number - click to go to the resources overview screen. = 
ⓓ: Happiness/unhappiness balance and either golden age with turns left or accumulated happiness with amount needed for a golden age is shown next to the smiley. Clicking also leads to the resources overview screen as luxury resources are a way to improve happiness. = 
ⓔ: The ⍾Science icon shows the number of ⍾Science points produced per turn. Clicking leads to the technology tree. = 
ⓕ: Number of turns played with translation into calendar years. Click to see the victory overview. = 
ⓖ: The number of gold coins in your treasury and income. Clicks lead to the Stats overview screen. = 
ⓗ: The quantity of ☮Faith your citizens have generated, or 'off' if religion is disabled. Clicking it makes you go to the religion overview screen. = 
ⓧ: In the center of all this - the world map! Here, the "X" marks a spot outside the map. Yes, unless the wrap option was used, Unciv worlds are flat. Don't worry, your ships won't fall off the edge. = 
ⓨ: By the way, here's how an empire border looks like - it's in the national colours of the nation owning the territory. = 
ⓩ: And this is the red targeting circle that led to the attack pane back under ⑬. = 
What you don't see: The phone/tablet's back button will pop the question whether you wish to leave Unciv and go back to Real Life. On desktop versions, you can use the ESC key. = 

When at later stages of the game, you might have a lot of units but only a little to do. To help you we have implemented an AutoPlay feature that lets you use the AI to play part or all of your turn. = 
To enable AutoPlay, go to options and open the AutoPlay tab and press "Show AutoPlay button". = 
Clicking on the AutoPlay button opens a popup menue for choosing to AutoPlay parts or all of your turn. = 
Clicking Start AutoPlay in the pop-up menue or long pressing the AutoPlay button begins the multi-turn AutoPlay. This will play your next turns as if you were an AI. = 
To cancel multi-turn AutoPlay you can press the AutoPlay button, next turn button or open the options menue. = 
Multi-turn AutoPlay is not advised on harder difficulty levels as your AI will not play better against an AI with modifiers. = 
Multi-turn AutoPlay for multiplayer is not yet supported. = 

After building a shrine, your civilization will start generating ☮Faith. = 
When enough ☮Faith has been generated, you will be able to found a pantheon. = 
A pantheon will provide a small bonus for your civilization that will apply to all cities that have it as a majority religion. = 
Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = 
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = 

Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = 
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = 
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = 
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = 
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = 
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = 
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = 
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = 

Beliefs = 
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = 
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = 

Religion inside cities = 
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = 
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = 
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the City Screen. = 
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = 
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = 
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = 
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = 

Spreading Religion = 
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = 
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = 
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = 
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = 
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = 
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = 
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = 
This pressure can also be seen in the City Screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 

Inquisitors = 
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = 
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = 
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = 
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = 
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is unaffected. = 

The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = 

Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = 
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = 

Air Combat and Interception = 
Air Combat is very similar to normal Combat, with a few wrinkles. Damage is still dealt using the same equations based on the relative Strength of the Attacking and Defending Unit. = 
However, before the Attacker and Defender fight, there is an added combat phase called Interception. If there is any unit with Interception Range that covers the target attacked tile, then it will attempt to Intercept the Attacking Air Unit. If multiple units can Intercept, the one with higher Intercept chance does it. = 
Generally Land/Naval Units have an Intercept Range of 2 Tiles, and Air Units have an Intercept Range of their Attack Range. = 
Ground and Naval Units don't require movement points to Intercept, just Attacks. Air Units cannot have moved nor attacked in the preceding turn. = 
The Intercepting Unit rolls to see if it hits. Whether it hits or not costs an Attack, and most units (without Promotions) can only Attack Once per Nation's Turn. It does NOT cost Movement Points, but Air Units that have used their Movement cannot Intercept between turns. = 
If the Intercepting Unit Hits, it deals damage according to the Combat Strength calculation to the Attacking Air Unit, potentially with any Strength Bonuses that apply to Interception. It does not receive damage from the Attacking Air Unit. = 
After Interception resolves, the Attacking Air Unit and the Defending Unit in the targeted tile do Combat as normal, with damage dealt to both sides. = 
To help deal with Interceptions, see Air Sweeps. = 

Air Sweeps = 
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = 
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = 
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = 
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = 
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = 

Fortify, Guard, Withdraw = 
Most Land units have the ability to Fortify. As they spend time without moving, they will slowly gain a Fortification Bonus to their Combat Strength representing digging in and preparing in case of an attack. = 
Some units have the ability to Withdraw before a melee attack is struck. However, perhaps you wish for them to stand their ground to protect a particular tile. If you do, then give them the Guard command and they will stay fixed until they die or you give them fresh orders. = 
This is NOT the same as Fortify but they will still gain the Fortification Bonus. They will simply not utilize their Withdraw ability. Fortified units with the Withdraw ability will try to flee when attacked. = 

City Tile Blockade = 
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = 
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = 

City Blockade = 
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = 

Spies! = 
The first time a civ reaches the Renaissance era each nation gets one spy. Every time a civ reaches an era afterwards they get one more spy. = 
Spies can be sent out to foreign cities to steal technology, rigging elections or stage coups. Place them in your own cities to do counter-intelligence work. = 
Only one spy per civ is allowed in each city. Spies that are not in any city are on vacation in your spy hideout. = 
Spies set up in cities of major civilizations will try to steal technology at a rate which is based off of the science production in the city. Succeeding to steal technology will level up your spy. Failing to succeed will level up the defending spy if it is present. = 
Spies set in city-states will try to rig the elections in order to gain influence and reduce the influence of other civilizations. Only one spy partaking in rigging the election can win. = 
A spy that is rigging an election in a city-state may also stage a coup. The likelihood of success for the coup depends on your relative influence to the current ally of the city-state, your spy level, and the level of the spy that the current ally has in the city-state if present. Succeeding a coup will make you their new ally and reduce the influence of all other civs. Failing a coup will kill your spy and level up the defending spy if present. = 
Spies that are set up in your own cities will be conducting counter-intelligence. They reduce the success chance of other spies trying to steal your technology. = 
Spies at a higher rank have a higher chance of success. The max rank a spy can reach is rank 3. After a spy is killed it will revive after a certain amount of turns back at rank 1. = 
Building buildings like the constabulary and police station will reduce the technology steal rate of spies in that city. = 
Espionage is available using the Gods and Kings ruleset. To enable it in a new game click advanced settings, then click on the Enable Espionage option. = 

Keyboard Bindings = 
Limitations = 
This is a work in progress. = 
For technical reasons, only direct keys or Ctrl-Letter combinations can be used. = 
Using the Keys page = 
Each binding has a button with an image looking like this: = 
While hovering the mouse over the key button, you can press a desired key directly to assign it. = 
Double-click the image to reset the binding to default. = 
Bindings mapped to their default keys are displayed in gray, those reassigned by you in white. = 
Conflicting assignments are marked red. Conflicts can exist across categories, like World Screen / Unit Actions. Note that at the moment, the game does not prevent saving conflicting assignments, though the result may be unexpected. = 
For discussion about missing entries, see the linked github issue. = 

Welcome to the Civilopedia! = 
Here you can find information - general help, rules, and what makes up the game world. = 
How to find information = 
Select categories with the buttons on top of the screen. Also up there is the button to leave Civilopedia and go back to where you were before. = 
Each category has a list of entries on the left of the screen, sorted alphabetically (with few exceptions). Clicking an entry will update the center pane were you are currently reading this. = 
Lines can link to other Civilopedia entries, they are marked with a chain link symbol like this one. You can click anywhere on the line to follow the link. = 
The current category is special - all articles on general concepts are here. It is called 'Tutorials' because you can revisit these here, too. = 
What information can I find = 
The data shown is not dependent on your current game's situation, e.g. bonuses for the nation you are playing or difficulty modifiers will not affect the numbers. = 
However, it will reflect the mods you are playing! The combination of base ruleset and extension mods you select define the rules of a game, what objects exist and how they interact, and the Civilopedia mirrors these rules. = 
If you opened the Civilopedia from the main menu, the "Ruleset" will be that of the last game you started. = 
Letters can select categories, and when there are multiple categories matching the same letter, you can press that repeatedly to cycle between these. = 
The arrow keys allow navigation as well - left/right for categories, up/down for entries. = 

UI Tips = 
World screen = 
Skip all units to end a turn quickly = 
Right-click or long press the "Next unit" button to open a popup menu which allows to end a turn without having to cycle through all units. If some units are automated, a dedicated button is available to move them before ending the turn. = 
Toggle notification list display = 
On the World screen, swipe the notification list to the right to temporarily hide it. Click the "Bell" button to display them again. = 
The default state for the notification list can be set in Options > Display > UI - Notifications on world screen. = 
Entering a City Screen quickly = 
You can Right-click or long press a city button on the World screen. The result is the same as tapping it twice - once to select and move the button, again to trigger a reaction: show the City Screen (if the city is yours to inspect), or offer the foreign city info popup. = 
Upgrade multiple units of the same type = 
On the World screen, select an unit that can be upgraded, then right-click or long press the "Upgrade" button to open a popup menu allowing to upgrade all units of this type at once. = 
In the Units overview, the same upgrade menu is available by clicking the unit icon in the "Upgrade" column. When an unit is upgradeable, the icon is lit if conditions are met (enough gold and/or resources), otherwise it is dimmed. = 
Additional controls for the construction queue = 
Right-click or long press a construction item to open a popup menu with additional controls, allowing to manage production of the same item in all cities, by issuing the commands from the same City Screen. = 
The "Disable" option moves an item to a separated "Disabled" tab, preventing its automatic queueing by the "Auto-assign city production" option. To move a disabled item back to its initial place, enter again the popup menu, and choose "Enable". = 
Disabled items are set globally and persistent: they are not reset in a new game, or by restarting Unciv. = 
Show Great Person Points breakdown = 
In the right sidepanel, click a Great People row to display the details of Great Person Points (GPP) accumulated each turn by the current city, for this type of Great People. = 
Click any of the Great People icons to display all GPP accumulated each turn by the current city, for all types of Great People. = 
Tech screen = 
Queue multiple technologies in different branches = 
On the Tech screen, right-click or long press a technology to automatically queue it, even if this tech is in another branch than the item currently researched. Prerequisite techs to research will also be automatically queued. = 
Right-click or long press multiple techs to append them to the research queue, whatever their branch is. = 
Overview screens = 
Reveal known resources on world screen = 
In the Resources overview, click on a resource icon to center the world screen on tiles already discovered and providing this resource. = 
Alternatively, click on the "Unimproved" number to center the world screen only on owned (by you or your allied City-states) tiles where the resource is not improved. = 
If more than one tile is available, click repeatedly on the notification to cycle through all of them. = 
Show diagram line colors = 
In Politics overview > Show diagram, you can click anywhere inside the diagram to display a table listing all relationship line colors and their meaning. = 
Miscellaneous = 
External links = 
External links support right-click or long press to copy the link to the clipboard instead of launching the browser. = 
Example: The 'Open Github page' button on the Mod management screen. = 

Differences from Civilization V = 
Production Focus\nIn Civilization V, the Food yield in a city is calculated first, then population grows by consuming stored food (growth), then production is calculated, and so on one by one the other stats are calculated. Thus, citizens can produce yields in the same turn as they are born. The city focus is set to Production to assign the newborn citizen to a hill so they'll contribute Production, and then manually reassigned to a growth tile on the next turn. Alternatively, you can set city focus to Gold (e.g. with Cerro de Potosi), Faith (e.g. with Mount Sinai) or whatever gains the most yields. In Unciv, citizens only start producing yields on the next turn, so you can ignore this whole concept. = 
Science Queueing\nIn Civilization V, Science yield is calculated after production, so if you finish an item and have Science (or Gold) queued as a perpetual construction, the Production overflow from item will be converted into Science (or Gold), but the Production is not consumed, as this will only happen again on the next turn. By immediately swapping out your perpetual construction for an item on the next turn, you'll get this Science (or Gold) for free. This doesn't apply to Unciv, so don't bother. = 
Double Aqueducts\nIn Civilization V, the game sells existing copies of the building for you before providing a free copy of the building. So, if you build an aqueduct in a city, and then in the turn of adopting Tradition Complete you sell a cheap building (e.g a shrine) beforehand, the game is unable to sell more than 1 building per turn, and thus you'll keep your aqueduct, together with the new free aqueduct. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
Legalism Oxford\nIn Civilization V, national wonders such as Oxford University are considered culture buildings, so you can get them for free with Legalism. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
Roads and Forts\nIn Civilization V, you can't use roads and forts in enemy territory. In Unciv, you can use them, so instead of mindlessly constructing them everywhere when at war, you need to decide if and when they'll benefit you more than your opponents. = 
Citizen Conversion\nIn Civilization V, a citizen is born religious if the parent city is already converted. This is not the case in Unciv, which can lead to temporary deconversion of a city when it grows. = 
Unassigned Citizens\nIn Civilization V, unassigned citizens are considered specialists, and subject to the same type of bonuses (e.g. Korea's ability). It can be worthwhile to leave citizens unassigned, instead of being assigned to a tile. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
Settler Construction\nIn Civilization V, cities can't starve when constructing settlers, so you can assign all citizens to production tiles and none to food tiles. In Unciv, citizens keep consuming two food per turn. = 
Water Melee Attack\nAs result of a Discord poll, Water Melee units can attack military land units on the shore, unlike in Civilization V. = 
Tile improvements\nIn Civilzation V, workers start working on an improvement-under-construction at the beginning of movement. Unciv changes this, to allow players to assign workers to tiles, and then reconsider and change improvement or move them elsewhere. = 
Forest and Jungle Visibility\nIn Unciv, forests and jungles are visible 1 tile outside visibility range. In Civilization V, this is the behaviour of hills and mountains, but not of forests and jungles, yet jungle and forest can block hills, and hill + forest can block mountain, indicating they're on the same elevation. This is considered to be a bug in the otherwise well-structured visibility logic in Civilization V. = 
City razing\nIn Civilization V, the player can never raze any of the cities he/she founded. Not applicable to Unciv. = 

Founding Cities\nThe Settler is a unit that can found a new city. You can build a Settler unit in a city with at least 2 population, and then move them to a good location to found a new city. This will usually be your main way of acquiring more cities. = 
Food conversion to Production\nDuring the construction of a Settler, the city will not grow. Instead, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and from there on every 4th, excess Food (Growth) is converted into Production, with the rest of the excess Food being lost. =
