# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that
# may not turn into valid sentences. Therefore we have the following two translations to determine
# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

ConditionalsPlacement = before

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you! India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land. Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty. For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders. In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place. In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority. After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history! = 我们向印度的伟大领袖，智慧的甘地致敬！印度是世界上最古老的国家之一，拥有10000年的历史，建立在精神和宗教之上，因为世界上三大宗教——印度教、佛教和耆那教——都诞生在这片神圣的土地上。印度社会的各个方面都尊崇艺术、音乐和色彩，既展现出巨大的财富，也揭示出极度的贫困。几个世纪以来，印度一直饱受本地王国之间的争斗和抵御外来侵略者的困扰。公元12世纪，穆斯林突厥人试图征服印度，随后蒙古人取而代之。17世纪初，印度仍然四分五裂，被英国人及其外交手段和技术优势所殖民。经过两个世纪的英国统治，印度民族主义觉醒，而您，伟大的甘地，领导了一场历史上从未有过的和平而胜利的反抗！
Gandhi, your people ask again to be led on the path of freedom. Under protection of Ganesha and Surya, can India accomplish its great potential? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? = 甘地，您的人民再次请求您引领他们走向自由之路。在象头神和太阳神的庇护下，印度能否实现其巨大潜力？您的新帝国会在历史的长河中闪耀吗？

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario since the ancient ages, on a land that will be later known as New York city. Long ago, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida became one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. Although not having a written language, the wise Iroquois created the Great Law of Peace, which can be considered the first established constitution. For decades, your people fought powerful enemies, such as the Huron, and then the French and English colonists. With less warriors and inferior weaponry, the Iroquois still survived and walk on the path of peace and harmony, until their way of living faded away under the crush of the newborn United States nation. = 向你问好，尊贵的海华沙，强大的易洛魁部落的领袖！自古以来，你的族人就居住在伟大而神圣的安大略湖畔，这片土地后来被称为纽约市。很久以前，塞内卡、奥农达加、莫霍克、凯尤加和奥利达这五个部落合并为一个国家，即豪德诺索尼，也就是易洛魁。虽然没有书面语言，但聪明的易洛魁人制定了《大和平法》，这可以被视为第一部成文宪法。几十年来，你们的人民与强大的敌人作战，如休伦人，然后是法国和英国殖民者。尽管战士人数较少，武器装备较差，但易洛魁人仍然顽强生存，并继续走和平与和谐的道路，直到他们的生活方式在新生的美国国家的冲击下逐渐消失。

Great King Darius of Persia, the heaven casts its light upon you! Persian people are strong and wise, as their leader. In old ages, the great Persian king Cyrus fought back the mighty Median empire and finally destroyed the Medes in 550 BC. Cunning diplomacy and military achievements helped then to conquer the wealthy Lydia and the powerful Babylon, Cyrus' son conquering the eternal Egypt some years later. At the height of its power, the Persian Empire reached the shores of Macedonia, at the very door of the upstart Greek city-states. Persia would have prospered for centuries if Alexander of Macedon hadn't brutally destroyed the great empire in one violent strike. = 波斯伟大的大流士国王，上天将光辉照耀于你！波斯人民坚强而智慧，正如他们的领袖一样。在古代，伟大的波斯国王居鲁士反击了强大的米底亚帝国，最终在公元前550年将其摧毁。狡猾的外交手腕和军事成就帮助他们征服了富有的吕底亚和强大的巴比伦，几年后，居鲁士的儿子征服了永恒的埃及。在其权力的鼎盛时期，波斯帝国到达了马其顿的海岸，就在新兴的希腊城邦的大门口。如果不是马其顿的亚历山大在一次猛烈的打击中残酷地摧毁了这个伟大的帝国，波斯本可以繁荣几个世纪。
King Darius, the people of Persia await, longing for its past glory and power! Persia of the Immortals must reborn, to punish its foes and rebuild the gleaming Persepolis!

In some 200 years, double-sided alliances and martial prowess made of the Aztecs the dominant power in the Central American basin, forming a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea. Alas, the empire fell under the assault of foreign devils - the Spaniards and many curses they brought with them!

Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 您好，欢迎来到绚丽多彩的Unciv游戏世界！\n文明游戏是复杂的，让我们通过一些简单的任务来熟悉它吧。\n这些任务是可选的，当然您也可以自己探索游戏世界！

Welcome to Unciv! = 欢迎来到Unciv！
Because this is a complex game, there are some tutorials to help familiarize you with it. These can be disbaled in the Options -> Display menu, but please hang on if you're new here! = 这款游戏有点复杂，所以我们做了教程来帮助你熟悉游戏。这些教程可以在选项 -> 显示菜单中禁用，但如果你是萌新，请坚持走一遍教程！
Your first mission is to found your capital city. This is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous. Many game bonuses apply only to your capital city, and it will be the center of your empire. = 你的首要任务是建立你的首都。因为你的首都可能会成为你最繁荣的城市。许多游戏奖励只适用于你的首都，它将是你的帝国中心。
How do you know a city location is appropriate? Luckily, the game has already chosen a good location for you. You can settle in this place, or maybe move a turn to found on a Hill (for Production and defence) or next to a Mountain (to gain access to the Observatory building later on). = 你怎么知道一个城市的位置是否合适？游戏已经为你选择了一个好位置。你可以在这个位置定居，或者移动一回合去建立在山上(为了生产和防御)或者靠近山脉(以便稍后获得天文台建筑)。
You'll likely want more cities later on. For these cities, you must go and find a good place. Looking for and founding on or near Luxury resources is a good rule of thumb. = 你以后可能想要更多的城市。对于这些城市，你必须去寻找一个好地方，尽量建立在奢侈品资源上或附近。
Luxury resources are tiles that have things like Gems, Cotton, or Silk (indicated by a yellow background of the resource icon). These resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as Iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to keep in mind! = 奢侈品资源是那些有宝石、棉花或丝绸等资源的地块(黄色背景的资源图标)。这些资源使你的文明感到快乐。你还应该留意建造单位所需的资源，比如铁。注意，城市不能建在现有城市3格范围内！
Cities will house Citizens, which can work tiles up to 3 tiles away from the city. This means you don’t have to settle cities right on or next to good tiles. Let’s say, for example, that you want access to some Iron – but the resource is in a desert area. You don’t have to settle your city in the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands. Your city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource. You only need to settle right on top of resources if you need them immediately. = 城市将容纳公民，他们可以在城市外3格范围内工作。这意味着你不必在好地块上或旁边建立城市。比如说，你想要获得一些铁——但资源在沙漠地区。你不必在沙漠中建立你的城市。你可以在更肥沃的土地上几格之外建立城市。你的城市会增长，最终获得资源。只有当你立即需要资源时，你才需要直接在资源上建立城市。
The first thing coming out of your city depends on the strategy you want to follow, but the 'classic' build order is to build first two Scouts, then a Shrine, and three Settlers, and adopt Tradition, to explore the map quickly (Scouts ignore terrain cost), and to get an early Pantheon (if you're playing with religion enabled). = 你的城市首先产出的东西取决于你想遵循的策略，但“经典”的建造顺序是先建造两个斥候，然后是神社，接着是三个移民，并采纳传统政策，以快速探索地图(侦察兵忽略地形成本)，并尽早获得一个万神殿(如果你启用了宗教)。
But feel free to experiment with your own build orders! = 但请随意尝试建造顺序！

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 在游戏开始的最初几回合，\n您只需进行很少的操作。\n但随着您的文明的发展，\n很多事情必须面面俱到。

Culture and Policies = 文化与政策
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 每回合，从您的所有城市获得的文化会加到您文明的文化上。\n当您有足够的文化时, 可以推行一项社会政策，\n每项社会政策都给您一定的奖励。
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 社会政策被划分成几个分支，每个分支都有自己的子政策，\n当一个分支社会政策的所有子政策都被推行，\n会有一个额外的奖励。
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 随着每项社会政策的推行，每座城市的建立，\n推行新的社会政策时的文化花费会随之提升--所以要明智地选择!

City Expansion = 城市扩张
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 当一个城市积累了足够的文化时，城市的边界就会扩张一个临近地块。\n您无法控制它将扩张到哪个地块，但系统会优先考虑拥有资源和更高产出收益的地块。
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 每扩张一个地块都需要更多的文化，但一般来说，你的第一个城市最终会扩张到拥有一个广阔的领土范围。
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 虽然你的城市将会永远扩张下去，但你的市民只能在距离城市中心3格内的地块上工作。\n在建立新城市时应考虑到这一点。

Food is the resource fundamental to your Cities', and as a result Nation's, population and health. = 食物是维持城市和国家人口与健康的基本资源。
Every Citizen in each City consumes Food per turn. Any left over is considered Growth and is stored in the City Center. Once enough accumulates, the City Grows and a new Citizen is added. = 每个城市的每个人口每回合都会消耗食物。余粮被视为增长，并储存在市中心。一旦积累足够，城市将会增长一个新人口。
Initially your main source of Food is the City Center itself and working a surrounding tile with a Citizen. You can increase how much is generated by gaining more Citizens to work more tiles, improving the tiles so that they yield more Food, and eventually Buildings and Policies. = 您早期的主要食物来源是城市中心本身和用人口开垦周围的地块。您可以通过增加更多的市民来开垦更多的地块，改善地块以获得更多的食物，并最终通过建筑和政策来增加食物产量。
Since a city's number of Citizens, or Population, determines how many tiles a City can work, Food is often the most important Resource. = 由于城市的人口决定了城市可以开垦多少地块，食物通常是最重要的资源。

Production is the resource that lets a City Center build new things. = 产能是让市中心建造新事物的资源。
This can be new Buildings that are added to the City Center, or new Units that can go out across the World Map to advance your Nation's goals. = 这些新事物可以是添加到市中心的新建筑，或者是可以在世界地图上行动以推进国家目标的新单位。
Everything you can build has a Production Cost. Every turn each City generates a certain amount of Production and puts it towards whatever is at the top of the Build Queue. Once the total cost is collected, the Building or Unit is built! = 你能建造的每样东西都有一个生产成本。每回合每个城市会产生一定数量的产能，并将其投入到建造队列顶部的项目中。一旦总成本被收集完成，建筑或单位就会被建造出来！
Any excess Production after something is built is overflowed to the next thing the City builds. Up to it's total Production Cost. = 建造完成后任何多余的产能都会溢出到城市建造的下一个项目，直到其总生产成本为止。
Since this determines how quickly you can build more stuff, your Nation's Production Capacity is crucial to it's advancement and survival. = 由于这决定了你能多快地建造更多东西，国家的生产能力对其发展和生存至关重要。

⍾Science is the resource that unlocks new and exciting Technologies for your Nation. = ⍾科研是为您的国家解锁新科技的资源。
Once you've Founded your Capital, you'll be prompted to Pick a Technology to Research. = 一旦您建立了首都，系统会提示您选择一项技术进行研究。
Every Technology costs an amount of ⍾Science. Every turn the ⍾Science your Nation produces is paid towards Researching your chosen Technology. = 每项技术都有一定的⍾科研成本。每回合您的国家产生的⍾科研将用于研究您选择的技术。
Once a Technology has it's cost fully paid, you unlock the benefits for your Nation! This could be new Units, Buildings, or other advantages. Any surplus will overflow into the next Technology you pick to Research. = 一旦一项技术的成本完全支付，您就会为您的国家解锁这些科技带来的好处！这些好处可能是新的单位、建筑或其他优势。任何剩余的科研点数会溢出到您选择研究的下一项科技中。
Researching a Technology in the next Era will advance you into that Era and trigger a notification to other Nations about how amazing you are! = 研究下一时代的科技将使您进入该时代，并向其他国家发送通知，告知他们您的卓越成就！
Since new Technologies tend to give access to better Units, Buildings, and even unlock powerful new Policies, staying ahead of the competition is one of the best ways to secure your Victory! = 由于新技科技往往可以提供更好的单位、建筑，甚至解锁强大的新政策，领先于竞争对手是确保您获得胜利的最佳方式之一！

Ah Gold. The Universal Medium of Exchange. Everyone loves Gold! They say it can't buy Happiness, but nuclear submarines are almost as good. = 黄金是通用的交换媒介。每个人都喜欢黄金！有钱不一定幸福，但没钱一定不幸福。
You can earn more Gold from Tiles, Resources, Improvements, and eventually Buildings, Specialists, and Trade Routes. Ancient Ruins, meeting new City-States, and Pillaging are also great sources of Gold. During a Golden Age every Tile that already yields Gold will yield an additional Gold! = 您可以通过地块、资源、改良改良，以及最终的建筑、专家和贸易路线来赚取更多黄金。古代遗迹、遇见新的城邦和掠夺也是黄金的绝佳来源。在黄金时代，每个已经产出黄金的地块将额外产出黄金！
Gold is how you pay for Building Maintenance, Transportation Upkeep, and Unit Upkeep. If you run out of Gold, first you'll receive penalties to your ⍾Science production, then eventually your Units will start Disbanding as you can't pay their upkeep. = 黄金用于支付建筑维护、运输维护和单位维护费用。如果您用完了黄金，首先您的⍾科科研产量将受到惩罚，最终您的单位将开始解散，因为您无法支付他们的维护费用。
Gold can be used to Buy Buildings and Units, helping bring up a new City or quickly build an Army. It can also buy Tiles to add to your City. It's also used to Upgrade your units from their older, obsolete forms to new, stronger versions. And investing it into a Research Agreement is a great way to convert it into ⍾Science. = 黄金可以用来购买建筑和单位，帮助建立新的城市或快速建立军队。它还可以购买地块以扩展您的城市。它还可以用来升级您的单位，从旧的、过时的形式升级到新的、更强的版本。将其投资于科研协定是将其转化为⍾科研的好方法。
Gold is also very valuable in Diplomacy. You can directly Gift Gold to City-States to gain their favor. Use it to balance a Trade Deal with other Nations. Or demand every last drop after a successful war and your enemy sues for peace. = 黄金在外交中也非常有价值。您可以直接赠送黄金给城邦以获得他们的好感。用它来平衡与其他国家的贸易协议。或者在成功的战争后要求对方在求和时交出每一滴黄金。
Ironically, some may consider Gold to be one of the less important Resources. But it's flexible nature and importance to keep your Nation running makes it a precious thing to pay attention to. After all, everyone loves Gold. = 讽刺的是，有些人可能认为黄金是较不重要的资源之一。但它的灵活性和维持国家运转的重要性使其成为值得关注的宝贵资源。毕竟，每个人都喜欢黄金。
Not to be confused with the Resource of the same name, Gold Ore = 不要与同名资源黄金(奢侈品)混淆

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 随着城市规模扩大，城市的可工作地块也会变得越来越多。\n这时，你将不得不面对游戏中关于“快乐”的机制。在游戏中，快乐的产出是所有城市总和计算，\n快乐的消耗则由城市数量和人口数量决定。\n随着城市数量的增加和城市人口的增长您将会很快发现：保持你的文明始终处于快乐是一件越来越难的事。
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 此外，在未研发相关科技前您将无法建造任何能增加快乐的建筑、奇观和开发可以增加快乐的奢侈资源。\n如果您的文明处于不满，将会极大地减慢城市发展速度。\n如果文明的不满状态非常严重(顶部信息栏用一个“哭脸”标示)，\n您的部队战斗力将会有极大的减成。
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 这意味着在Unciv中很难快速扩张。\n这不是不可能的，但作为一名新玩家，您可能不应该这样做。\n那么您应该怎么做？通过建筑工人来放松、侦察并改善您拥有的土地。\n一旦您找到了一个您认为合适的地点，就要建造新的城市。

Unhappiness = 不满
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 看来你的市民很不开心!\n当他们不快乐时，你的文明将遭受许多有害的影响\n随着不快乐程度的提高\n影响会越来越严重。
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 产生不满的原因有两个:人口数和城市数，\n每座城市产生3点不满，每个市民产生1点不满。
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 有两种主要的方法来消除不满：\n为您的人民建造能增加快乐的建筑物\n或在您的境内改善奢侈资源。

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 您的文明进入了一个黄金时代!\n您的快乐每个回合都会积累，\n当快乐积累到一定数值就会开启一个黄金时代。\n在黄金时代，文化和产能产出+20%，\n每个至少产出1金钱的地块将额外提供1金钱。

Roads and Railroads = 道路与铁路
Roads reduce the Movement Points required to move between two tiles connected by Roads. = 连成线的道路会减小经过单位的移动力损耗。
Railroads improve this reduction even more! = 铁路相比道路效果更强！
This greatly improves the speed you can get Units around the map. = 这会极大改善你单位的机动能力。
Until you research the technology that removes it, Roads do not cross Rivers = 道路不会取消跨河移动的惩罚，除非你已研究移除此惩罚的科技
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. = 用道路或铁路将你的首都与其他城市连接起来，会为你产出贸易路线的金钱。
However, since each Road and Railroad have a Maintenance Cost, it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow and only place where needed. = 但是道路和铁路本身也需要你支出金钱作为维护费，优先在大城市间修路是笔划算的买卖。

Trade Route = 贸易路线
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. You earn more Gold the more Population the City and your Capital has. = 用道路或铁路将你的首都与其他城市连接起来，会为你产出贸易路线的金钱。这份金钱取决于你首都和另一城市的人口数量。
Note that each road costs 1 Gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 Gold, so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 注意！每格道路每回合扣除1金钱，铁路扣除2金钱，所以优先在大城市间修路更划算。
Railroads connecting a city to the Capital also provide a 25% Production Boost to the City, but not the Capital. = 用铁路将首都与其他城市连接起来，会为其他城市提供25%的产能加成！
Trade Routes are also connected over Water via certain buildings like the Harbor. As long as there is a chain that can reach the Capital, there's a Trade Route. Look for this symbol in Yellow below the City Name to mean you have an active Trade Route to your Capital. = 贸易还可以通过水路进行，只要你的沿海城市修建了港口。一旦有一座与你首都陆路连接的临海城市修建了港口，其他所有修建港口的临海城市也会建立贸易路线。城市名字下方的黄色小三角就表示此城市已与首都建立贸易路线。
Trade Routes can get broken either by Blockades or by Removing/Pillaging the connecting Road/Railroad chain. = 贸易路线随时会因为连接线路破损而崩溃，注意保护。
See also City Blockade = 另见城市封锁

Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 当您建立了两三座城市后，可能已经经过了100～150回合，\n这时您应该思考和谋划如何赢得游戏的胜利--如果此时你还没有胜利的话！
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 有四种方法能让您赢得胜利：\n - 文化胜利：完成5项社会政策分支与乌托邦计划\n - 统治胜利：成为最后存续的文明\n - 科技胜利：建造完成飞往半人马座α星的太空飞船\n - 外交胜利：建立联合国并赢得竞选。
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 总的来说，这就是Unciv的基础了——建立一个繁荣的城市，小心翼翼地扩张以维持快乐值，向您所追求的胜利条件努力。\n当然，实际的游戏内容比这丰富得多，但在学会游泳之前，可最好别踏入深水区！

Enemy City = 敌方城市
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 您已经包围了敌人的一座城市!\n当城市的耐久降至1时就可以被占领。\n只能使用近战单位占领城市。\n城市每回合会自动回复少许耐久，所以最好先使用远程单位攻击它，\n同时使用您的近战单位来保护远程单位，直到城市被占领!

Luxury Resource = 奢侈资源
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 你的领土内的奢侈资源需要建造相应的改良来开发，已开发的奢侈资源可以用来与其他文明贸易。\n您拥有的每种独一无二的奢侈资源都会给您的文明+5快乐，\n每种奢侈资源只能提供一份快乐加成，数量超过1的同种资源并不会提供更多的快乐，\n所以用它们和其他文明进行贸易吧!

Strategic Resource = 战略资源
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 你的领土内的战略资源需要建造相应的改良来开发，已开发的战略资源可以用来与其他文明贸易。\n建造/组建特定的项目(单位/建筑)时将会消耗相应的战略资源。如需要消耗1单位的马来组建1个骑手单位，\n没有马就不能组建骑手。当该单位或建筑被摧毁时，此资源将能再次使用。\n如果获取资源途径出现中断，需要该资源的单位将受到战斗力减成，直至重新获得该资源。
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 与奢侈资源不同，地图上显示的每个战略资源图标将提供多于1单位的该种资源。\n顶部信息栏显示了你拥有多少未使用的战略资源。\n在概览界面点击“资源”按钮可以查看你所拥有资源的完整信息。

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 这座城市再也不能抵抗了!\n然而，要征服城市，请使用您的近战单位占领它。

After Conquering = 占领城市的处理
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 当你征服了一座城市，您可以选择解放、吞并、傀儡、甚至摧毁该城市。
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = \n“解放城市”让它回归原来的文明，会使你与他们的外交关系得到巨大的提升！\n\n“吞并城市”将会给予您该城市的绝对控制权，但该城市人口产生的不满将是正常值的2倍。\n在城市内建造法庭可以使人口产生的不满降低到正常值。\n\n“傀儡城市”意味着您将无法控制该城市的产能，\n该城市将不会额外增加您研发科技和推行社会政策时的花费，但该城市人口产生的不满是正常值的1.5倍。\n可以在任何时候吞并已傀儡的城市，但已吞并的城市无法再变为傀儡状态。\n\n“摧毁城市”可以令城市人口每回合-1，人口为0时城市将完全被摧毁。\n你不能摧毁一个文明的原始首都或一个宗教的圣城。

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 您遇到蛮族了！\n蛮族会不分青红皂白地攻击靠近它的每一个单位，\n所以请不要让您的移民等平民单位靠近他们，同时还要注意你的斥候！

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 您遇到了另一个文明!\n其他文明一开始是和平的，您可以和他们进行贸易，\n但是他们以后可能会选择对您宣战。

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 当您完成了阿波罗计划，可以开始在您的城市中建造飞船部件(需要相应科技)，\n来通过太空竞赛赢得科技胜利！

Injured Units = 受伤单位
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 报告大人，您的单位受伤了！\n受伤的单位会对敌方造成更少的伤害！您可能会好奇，怎么能治疗他们呢？其实很简单，您只需要在他们不受攻击的情况下原地待命，他们中的医疗兵就会开始工作了！\n在异国领土和无主的领土上，每回合会恢复10点生命值；在己方领土上，会恢复20点；在本方城市中，会恢复25点。

Workers = 工人
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 工人对您所在城市的发展至关重要，因为只有他们才能在地块上建造改良。\n改良可以提高地块的产出，\n当市民在建有改良的地块工作时，将给您的城市带来更多的收益，同时城市也会发展得更快。

Siege Units = 攻城单位
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 攻城单位对城市具有极强的毁灭力，但在进攻前必须先把它架设起来。\n您的攻城单位架设起来后，它就可以从当前的地块发起攻击，\n但是一旦它移动到其他地块，就需要重新架设。

Embarking = 陆军单位的船运
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 当一个特定的科技被研发后，你的陆地单位就可以进入水中。\n请注意，登船或下船需要花费一整个回合。
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 在水中的陆军单位是没有反伤的，并且根据你的科技时代有一个固定的防御能力。所以你最好看好你在水中的单位。\n水中的陆地远程单位不能攻击，近战单位有攻击力削弱，所有的单位视力削弱。(在研究特定的科技后可以消除这些DeBuff哦)

Idle Units = 空闲单位
Clicking 'Next unit' moves to the next idle unit in the queue (as listed in Overview -> Units). After issuing an order to an unit, if 'Auto Unit Cycle' in Options -> Gameplay is enabled, you will automatically select the next idle unit. = 点击“下个闲置单位”按钮会移动到队列中的下一个闲置单位(如在“概览”->“单位”中所列出的)。如果在“选项”->“游戏内容”中启用了“自动循环单位”，那么在向一个单位下达命令后，系统将自动选择下一个闲置单位。
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again, or command the unit to 'Skip turn'. = 如果你不想在这一回合移动某个单位，可以通过再次点击“下个闲置单位”按钮跳过它，或者命令该单位“跳过回合”。
If you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Options -> Gameplay -> Check for idle units. = 如果你想要完全禁用“下个闲置单位”功能，可以在“选项”->“游戏内容”->“回合结束前查看闲置单位”中切换该选项。
If you'd rather 'Next unit' cycle the units and not mark them as Done, you can change it in the Options -> Gameplay menu. = 如果你希望“下个闲置单位”功能在循环单位时不将它们标记为“已完成”，你可以在“选项”->“游戏内容”菜单中进行更改。
You can also cycle through the idle units using the left and right triangles on the Unit Table in the lower left of the screen. Or by default using the Cycle button next to the 'Next Unit' button. = 你还可以通过屏幕左下角的单位表中的左右三角按钮来循环浏览闲置单位。或者，默认情况下，也可以使用“下个闲置单位”按钮旁边的“循环”按钮来实现。

Contact Me = 联系我吧！
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n Unciv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 很好!当您已经熟悉了游戏的大部分内容，\n您会发现游戏目前是不完整的，它还处于开发状态。\n不过Unciv将永远是开源和免费的，\n这意味着您无须担心广告或付费问题。

Pillaging = 劫掠地块
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 军事单位可以劫掠地块改良，“劫掠”可以回复单位25点生命值同时将改良化为废墟。\n被“劫掠”的地块仍旧可以工作，但从地块改良获得的效果——例如基本资源加成和战略资源收益——将会消失。\n工人可以修复这些化为废墟的改良，所花费时间将比重新建造它们要少。\n劫掠特定的地块改良(比如牧场)可以为您带来金钱的收入。

Experience = 经验
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 战斗中单位获得的经验可用于该单位的晋升。\n单位在近战攻击时获得的经验大于远程攻击时，在进攻时获得的经验大于防御时。
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 单个单位与蛮族单位战斗时最多可获得30经验值-这意味着最多2次晋升。在那之后，该单位与蛮族单位战斗将不会获得任何经验。

Each Specialist will generate a certain amount of yield as indicated to the right of the available slots. = 每个专家都会产生一定数量的产出，具体数量会显示在可用岗位的右侧。
While these are a great way to specialize the yield production of a City outside of the surrounding Tile Yields, Specialists have an additional value. Each one also generates Great Person Points each turn. With enough of them, a new Great Person will join your Nation. = 虽然这是在周边地块产出之外，专门化城市产出的一个好方法，但专家还有额外的价值。每个专家每回合还会生成伟人点数。积累足够的伟人点数后，新的伟人将加入你的国家。
See also Great People = 另见伟人

Great People = 伟人

See also Specialists = 另见专家

Removing Terrain Features = 清除地貌
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = 某些地块含有地貌，如冲积平原或森林。其中一些图层(如丛林、沼泽和森林)可以由工人清除。\n清除地貌不会删除地块中的任何资源，通常需要"清除地貌"才能添加利用这些资源的改良。

Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, ⍾Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 自然奇观，例如富士山、直布罗陀岩和大堡礁，是独特的、不可逾越的地形特征，是大自然的杰作，它们具有使其与普通地形截然不同的特殊品质。\n如果由您的城市开发，它们可以为您带来大量的文化、⍾科研、金钱或产能，这就是为什么您可能需要尽快将它们纳入您的帝国。

Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = 一旦你建立了一种宗教，大先知会不时地诞生，尽管你要储存的信仰☮的数量会更高。

Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = 万神殿和追随者信仰适用于追随你信仰的每个城市，而创始人和增强者信仰只适用于宗教的创始人。

Religion inside cities = 城市中的宗教
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = 当建立一座城市时，它不会立即追随一种宗教。
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = 一个城市信奉的宗教取决于每个宗教在城市中的总压力。
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the City Screen. = 追随者的分配比例与这些压力相同，可以在城市屏幕上查看这些追随者。

In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = 你可以在概览界面来查看某一宗教的详细效果和其他信息。

Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 传教士可以在追随主要宗教的城市购买，并将接受该城市的宗教信仰。
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = 所以在哪里买的时候一定要小心！如果另一个文明把你们的一个城市变成了他们的宗教，在那里买来的传教士会追随他们的宗教。
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = 大先知出现时总是接受你的宗教信仰，即使他们是在追随其他宗教的城市里买来的，但是被俘虏的大先知保留了他们原来的宗教信仰。
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = 大先知和传教士都能将宗教传播到城市，甚至是其他文明的城市。
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = 这两个单位甚至可以进入你没有开放边界协议的文明！
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 但要当心，传教士在国外每结束一次回合就会失去250点宗教力量。
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 这削弱了他们传播宗教的效力，如果他们的宗教力量达到0，他们就失去了信仰，消失了。
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 当你传播你的宗教信仰时，这个单位的宗教力量会增加，成为该宗教的压力。
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = 城市也被动地向附近的城市施加他们主流宗教的压力。
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = 每个城市每回合向10个地块内的所有城市提供+6压力，尽管压力的确切大小取决于游戏速度。
This pressure can also be seen in the City Screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 这种压力也可以在城市屏幕上看到，让你了解如果你什么都不做，城市中的宗教将如何演变。
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 圣城也为自己提供了+30的宗教压力，这使得圣城很难有效地皈依。
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 最后，在建立一个宗教之前，你创建的新城市会给你的万神殿带来200压力。
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 这样，只要你还没有建立宗教，你所有的城市都将开始追随你的万神殿。

Inquisitors = 审判官

They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = 他们可以从你们自己的城市中移除所有其他宗教，移除任何建立起来的压力。
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = 大先知也有这种能力，在传播他们的宗教时，他们会清除城市中的所有其他宗教。
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = 这通常会导致城市立即皈依他们的宗教
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is unaffected. = 此外，当审判官驻扎在市中心或紧邻市中心时，其他宗教的单位无法在那里传播他们的信仰，尽管自然传播是无效的。

The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 玛雅的独特能力“长历法”带来了一个副作用：
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 一旦激活，游戏的年份显示将使用玛雅符号。
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 玛雅人从我们称之为公元前3114年8月11日开始以天为单位测量时间。1天被称为K'in，20 天被称为Winal，18 Winal被称为Tun，20 Tun被称为K'atun，20 K'atun被称为B'ak'tun，20 B'ak'tun被称为Piktun，以此类推。
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = Unciv仅显示ය B'ak'tun，ඹ K'atun和ම Tun(从左到右)，因为这足以近似公历年。玛雅数字很容易理解。祝你破译愉快！

Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 你的城市会定期要求得到不同的奢侈品，以满足他们对生活中新事物的渴望。

During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 在“我们爱戴领袖日”庆祝期间，该城市的增长速度将提高25%。
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = 这意味着探索和贸易对于发展你的城市有着重要的意义!

Air Combat and Interception = 空战
Air Combat is very similar to normal Combat, with a few wrinkles. Damage is still dealt using the same equations based on the relative Strength of the Attacking and Defending Unit. = 空战与常规战斗类似，也有不同。伤害仍然使用基于攻击单位和防御单位相对战斗力的相同公式进行计算。
However, before the Attacker and Defender fight, there is an added combat phase called Interception. If there is any unit with Interception Range that covers the target attacked tile, then it will attempt to Intercept the Attacking Air Unit. If multiple units can Intercept, the one with higher Intercept chance does it. = 注意！在攻击方和防御方交战之前，有一个额外的战斗阶段，称为拦截。如果有任何具有拦截范围的单位覆盖被攻击的格子，那么它将试图拦截攻击的空中单位。如果有多个单位可以拦截，拦截机会更高的单位将执行拦截。
Generally Land/Naval Units have an Intercept Range of 2 Tiles, and Air Units have an Intercept Range of their Attack Range. = 通常，陆地/海军单位的拦截范围为2格，空中单位的拦截范围为其攻击范围。
Ground and Naval Units don't require movement points to Intercept, just Attacks. Air Units cannot have moved nor attacked in the preceding turn. = 陆地和海军单位拦截时不需要移动力。空军单位发动拦截的前一回合不能移动也不能攻击。
The Intercepting Unit rolls to see if it hits. Whether it hits or not costs an Attack, and most units (without Promotions) can only Attack Once per Nation's Turn. It does NOT cost Movement Points, but Air Units that have used their Movement cannot Intercept between turns. = 拦截单位掷骰子看是否击中。无论是否击中，都会消耗一次攻击，并且大多数单位(可以通过晋升提高次数)每个国家的回合只能攻击一次。它不消耗移动力，但已经在回合中使用过移动的空中单位不能在接下来的回合中进行拦截。
If the Intercepting Unit Hits, it deals damage according to the Combat Strength calculation to the Attacking Air Unit, potentially with any Strength Bonuses that apply to Interception. It does not receive damage from the Attacking Air Unit. = 如果拦截成功，则根据拦截方战斗力计算对攻击空中单位的伤害，并考虑拦截方关于拦截加成的战力提升。它不会受到攻击空中单位的伤害。
After Interception resolves, the Attacking Air Unit and the Defending Unit in the targeted tile do Combat as normal, with damage dealt to both sides. = 拦截解除后，被攻击的格子中的攻击方和防御方将像往常一样进行战斗，双方都受到伤害。
To help deal with Interceptions, see Air Sweeps. = 为了帮助应对拦截，请查看词条空中扫荡。

Air Sweeps = 空中扫荡
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = 战斗机单位可以对一特定地块进行空中扫荡。并清除途中潜在的敌方布置于陆海空的拦截单位。
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = 虽然这一行动将可能让扫荡的单位被攻击，但好处是扫荡的单位将会吸引拦截，以帮助保护你的其他空中单位。尤其是你的轰炸机。
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = 如果你的单位能够到达目的地，即使拦截单位原本有几率不会拦截你的扫荡单位，你的扫荡单位也会一直飞行直到被拦截为止。(100%触发拦截)
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = 若拦截方不是空军单位(比如陆地或海上单位)，则双方都不会产生任何伤害！
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = 如果拦截方是空军单位，那么双方将直接开始战斗，且拦截方不会拥有拦截战斗力加成。但是进攻方可以享有空中扫荡的战斗力加成。

Fortify, Guard, Withdraw = 驻守，警戒，撤退
Most Land units have the ability to Fortify. As they spend time without moving, they will slowly gain a Fortification Bonus to their Combat Strength representing digging in and preparing in case of an attack. = 大多数陆地单位都有驻守的能力。当他们不移动时，他们会逐渐获得战斗力驻守加成，这代表了他们在准备防御攻击时挖掘和准备。
Some units have the ability to Withdraw before a melee attack is struck. However, perhaps you wish for them to stand their ground to protect a particular tile. If you do, then give them the Guard command and they will stay fixed until they die or you give them fresh orders. = 一些单位在近战攻击发生前有能力撤退。然而，也许你希望他们坚守阵地以保护特定的地块。如果你这样做，就给他们下达警戒命令，他们会一直坚守直到死亡或你给他们新的命令。
This is NOT the same as Fortify but they will still gain the Fortification Bonus. They will simply not utilize their Withdraw ability. Fortified units with the Withdraw ability will try to flee when attacked. = 这与驻守不同，但他们仍然会获得驻守加成。他们只是不会使用他们的撤退能力。具有撤退能力的驻守单位在受到攻击时会尝试逃跑。

City Tile Blockade = 城市地块封锁
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = 你的某些地块被敌人封锁了：当敌军站在你拥有的地块上时，该地块将没有任何产出，并且本回合不能被城市利用。城市将自动从被封锁的地块上重新分配人口。 
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = 敌方的陆地军事单位将封锁他们所处在的地块。敌方的海军部队还会封锁相邻的水域。为了保护你的地块不被封锁，可以在地块上放置一友好的军事单位，或击退入侵者。

City Blockade = 城市封锁
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = 你的某些城市被水路封锁了! —— 当沿海城市的所有相邻水域被封锁时，该城市将失去与所有其他城市的港口联系，包括首都。请确保通过部署友好的海军部队来解除对城市的封锁，击退入侵者。

Spies! = 间谍！

A spy that is rigging an election in a city-state may also stage a coup. The likelihood of success for the coup depends on your relative influence to the current ally of the city-state, your spy level, and the level of the spy that the current ally has in the city-state if present. Succeeding a coup will make you their new ally and reduce the influence of all other civs. Failing a coup will kill your spy and level up the defending spy if present. = 在城邦操纵选举的间谍也可能发动政变。政变成功的可能性取决于您对城邦当前盟友的相对影响力、您的间谍级别以及当前盟友在城邦中拥有的间谍级别(如果存在)。政变成功将使你成为他们的新盟友，并减少所有其他文明的影响力。政变失败将杀死你的间谍并升级防御间谍(如果存在)。
Spies that are set up in your own cities will be conducting counter-intelligence. They reduce the success chance of other spies trying to steal your technology. = 在你们自己的城市设立的间谍将进行反间谍活动。它们降低了其他间谍试图窃取您的科技的成功率。
Spies at a higher rank have a higher chance of success. The max rank a spy can reach is rank 3. After a spy is killed it will revive after a certain amount of turns back at rank 1. = 级别越高的间谍，成功的机会就越大。无模组时间谍的最高等级为3级。间谍被杀死后，经过一定的回合后会复活回到1级。
Building buildings like the constabulary and police station will reduce the technology steal rate of spies in that city. = 建造治安署和警察局等建筑物将降低该城市间谍的技术窃取率。

Differences from Civilization V = 与文明V的不同之处
Production Focus\nIn Civilization V, the Food yield in a city is calculated first, then population grows by consuming stored food (growth), then production is calculated, and so on one by one the other stats are calculated. Thus, citizens can produce yields in the same turn as they are born. The city focus is set to Production to assign the newborn citizen to a hill so they'll contribute Production, and then manually reassigned to a growth tile on the next turn. Alternatively, you can set city focus to Gold (e.g. with Cerro de Potosi), Faith (e.g. with Mount Sinai) or whatever gains the most yields. In Unciv, citizens only start producing yields on the next turn, so you can ignore this whole concept. = 工作重心\n在文明V中，城市的食物产量首先被计算，然后通过消耗存储的食物来增长人口(增长)，然后计算生产，以此类推，依次计算其他统计数据。因此，市民可以在出生的同时生产产出。将城市焦点设置为生产，以将新生市民分配到丘陵上，这样他们将为生产做出贡献，然后在下一轮手动重新分配到增长地块。或者，你可以将城市工作重心设置为金钱(如富饶山)，信仰(如西奈山)或任何带来最大产出的地方。在Unciv中，市民只会在下一回合开始生产产出，所以你可以忽略这个概念。
Science Queueing\nIn Civilization V, Science yield is calculated after production, so if you finish an item and have Science (or Gold) queued as a perpetual construction, the Production overflow from item will be converted into Science (or Gold), but the Production is not consumed, as this will only happen again on the next turn. By immediately swapping out your perpetual construction for an item on the next turn, you'll get this Science (or Gold) for free. This doesn't apply to Unciv, so don't bother. = 研究队列\n在文明V中，科研产出在产能产出之后计算，因此如果你完成一个科技并且已经将科研(或金钱)排队为永久建设，那么项目的生产溢出将转换为科研(或金钱)，但产能不会消耗，因为只会在下一回合再发生。通过立即在下一回合将你的永久建设换成项目，你将免费获得科学科研(或金钱)。这不适用于Unciv，所以不必担心。
Double Aqueducts\nIn Civilization V, the game sells existing copies of the building for you before providing a free copy of the building. So, if you build an aqueduct in a city, and then in the turn of adopting Tradition Complete you sell a cheap building (e.g a shrine) beforehand, the game is unable to sell more than 1 building per turn, and thus you'll keep your aqueduct, together with the new free aqueduct. Not applicable to Unciv. = 双引水渠\n在文明V中，游戏会在为你提供一个建筑物的免费复制之前出售现有的建筑物。因此，如果在一个城市中建造了一个水渠，并在采纳传统政策的回合之前卖掉了一个廉价建筑物(例如一个神社)，游戏无法在每回合出售多个建筑物，因此你将保留你的引水渠，并获得新的免费引水渠。不适用于Unciv。
Legalism Oxford\nIn Civilization V, national wonders such as Oxford University are considered culture buildings, so you can get them for free with Legalism. Not applicable to Unciv. = 律法统治的牛津大学\n在文明V中，像牛津大学这样的国家奇迹被视为文化建筑，因此你可以通过推行律法统治免费获得它们。不适用于Unciv。
Roads and Forts\nIn Civilization V, you can't use roads and forts in enemy territory. In Unciv, you can use them, so instead of mindlessly constructing them everywhere when at war, you need to decide if and when they'll benefit you more than your opponents. = 道路和堡垒\n在文明V中，你不能在敌方领土中使用路和堡垒。在Unciv中，你可以使用它们，所以在战争时无脑地在每个地方建造是没有意义的，你需要决定什么时候以及如何使用道路和堡垒比你的对手更有利。
Citizen Conversion\nIn Civilization V, a citizen is born religious if the parent city is already converted. This is not the case in Unciv, which can lead to temporary deconversion of a city when it grows. = 市民宗教转换\n在文明V中，如果父城市已经被转化，一个市民出生时会成为宗教市民。在Unciv中并非如此，这可能导致城市在增长时出现暂时的反转。
Unassigned Citizens\nIn Civilization V, unassigned citizens are considered specialists, and subject to the same type of bonuses (e.g. Korea's ability). It can be worthwhile to leave citizens unassigned, instead of being assigned to a tile. Not applicable to Unciv. = 未分配市民\n在文明V中，未分配市民被视为专家，并受到相同类型的奖励(例如朝鲜的特殊能力)影响；有时将市民保持未分配可能比分配到地块上更值得。不适用于Unciv。
Settler Construction\nIn Civilization V, cities can't starve when constructing settlers, so you can assign all citizens to production tiles and none to food tiles. In Unciv, citizens keep consuming two food per turn. = 组建移民\n在文明V中，建造殖民者时城市不会挨饿，因此你可以将所有市民分配到生产地块，而不是分配到食物地块。在Unciv中，市民每回合仍会消耗两个食物。
Water Melee Attack\nAs result of a Discord poll, Water Melee units can attack military land units on the shore, unlike in Civilization V. = 水陆突袭\n根据Discord上的投票结果，水陆突袭单位可以袭击岸上的军事陆地单位，这与文明V不同。
Tile improvements\nIn Civilzation V, workers start working on an improvement-under-construction at the beginning of movement. Unciv changes this, to allow players to assign workers to tiles, and then reconsider and change improvement or move them elsewhere. = 地块改良\n在文明V中，工人在移动时开始建造一个正在建设的改良。Unciv不同，可以让玩家将工人分配到地块上，然后重新考虑并更改改良或将它们移动工人。
Forest and Jungle Visibility\nIn Unciv, forests and jungles are visible 1 tile outside visibility range. In Civilization V, this is the behaviour of hills and mountains, but not of forests and jungles, yet jungle and forest can block hills, and hill + forest can block mountain, indicating they're on the same elevation. This is considered to be a bug in the otherwise well-structured visibility logic in Civilization V. = 森林和丛林的视野\n在Unciv中，森林和丛林的视野比视野范围大1个地块。在文明V中，这是山丘和山脉的行为，但不适用于森林和丛林，然而丛林和森林可以阻塞山丘，山丘+森林可以阻塞山脉，表明它们处于同一高度。在文明V中，与其他逻辑相比，这被认为是一个错误。
City razing\nIn Civilization V, the player can never raze any of the cities he/she founded. Not applicable to Unciv. = 屠城\n在《文明V》中，玩家永远无法摧毁自己建立的任何城市。本规则不适用于Unciv版本。

Founding Cities\nThe Settler is a unit that can found a new city. You can build a Settler unit in a city with at least 2 population, and then move them to a good location to found a new city. This will usually be your main way of acquiring more cities. = 建城\n移民是一个可以建立新城市的单位：你可以在至少有2个人口的城市中建造移民，然后将它们移动到一个好地块来建立一个新城市。这通常是你获取更多城市的主要途径。
Food conversion to Production\nDuring the construction of a Settler, the city will not grow. Instead, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and from there on every 4th, excess Food (Growth) is converted into Production, with the rest of the excess Food being lost. = 食物转化为生产\n在建造移民时，城市人口不会增长。相反，第1、第2、第4，以及从那时起每4，多余的食物(增长)会转化为产能，其余多余的食物将会丢失。
