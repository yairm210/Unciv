# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that
# may not turn into valid sentences. Therefore we have the following two translations to determine
# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

ConditionalsPlacement = before

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

May the blessings of heaven be upon you, O great Nebuchadnezzar, father of mighty and ancient Babylon!

Although conquered by the Kassites and then by the Assyrians, Babylon endured, emerging phoenix-like from its ashes of destruction and regaining its independence despite its many enemies.

O Nebuchadnezzar, your empire endured but a short time after your death, falling to the mighty Persians, and then to the Greeks, until the great city was destroyed by 141 BC. = 伟大的尼布甲尼撒，强大而古老的巴比伦之父，愿天堂的祝福降临到你身上！大约五千年前，萨尔贡 (Sargon) 建造巴比伦时，世界还很年轻，但它长期发展壮大，在公元前 18 世纪在神一般的汉谟拉比 (Hammurabi) 统治下获得了第一个帝国。 尽管先后被卡西特人征服，然后被亚述人征服，但巴比伦忍受着从毁灭的灰烬中崛起的凤凰般的苦难，并在敌众我寡的情况下重新获得了独立。 巴比伦确实是古代世界艺术和学习的中心。 尼布甲尼撒啊，你的帝国在你死后不久就一直存在，先后被强大的波斯人和希腊人打败，直到公元前 141 年这座伟大的城市被摧毁。

Blessings of God be upon you, oh Great Emperor Suleiman! Your power, wealth and generosity awe the world! Truly, are you called 'Magnificent!' Your empire began in Bithynia, a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century. Taking advantage in the decline of the great Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, King Osman I of Bithynia expanded west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your subjects brought down the empire of Byzantium, taking its holdings in Turkey and then the Balkans. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans captured ancient Constantinople, gaining control of the strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. Your people's empire would continue to expand for centuries governing much of North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height. = 愿真主指引您，伟大的奥斯曼苏丹苏莱曼大帝！您的声威、财富、胸怀使万民敬畏，与“立法者”之美名相当！您的帝国起源于比提尼亚，只是12世纪安纳托利亚以东一个微不足道的突厥部落。当塞尔柱部的罗姆苏丹衰落之时，奥斯曼一世乘时而起，攻入安纳托利亚，并在下一个百年击败了千年帝国拜占廷，接收了其在小亚细亚与巴尔干的臣民。15世纪中叶，不落之城君士坦丁堡终于被攻陷，奥斯曼为古罗马画上句点的同时，又掌握了从欧洲到中东的战略要冲。帝国的扩张持续好几个世纪，在颠峰之时，北非、中东、东欧都是帝国的一部分。

Will you accept the challenge, great emperor? Will you build an empire that will stand the test of time? = 全能的苏莱曼啊，请您呼应人民的召唤，带领帝国重回顶峰，再一次令奥斯曼成为世人钦佩与敬畏的对象吧。您会接受挑战吗，伟大的苏丹！您所建立的新帝国，能够永恒长存吗？

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10,000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, however, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks who fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and through a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological superiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! = 您好，印度的领袖圣雄甘地。您所带领的是一个非常古老的国度，一个历史可上溯一万年的国度，也是一个充满灵性的国度。印度是三个伟大宗教——印度教、佛教、耆那教的诞生地。这里的音乐与色彩充满热情。印度拥有巨大的财富，同时也存在令人难以忍受的贫困。数百年来，印度分裂成一个又一个邦国，互相攻伐之余，有时又能一致对外。12世纪时印度被伊斯兰化的突厥人征服，直至17世纪时英国人的到来，他们凭借狡猾的外交手段与科技的绝对优势，再一次将四分五裂的印度征服。英国人的统治延续了两个世纪，唤醒了印度民族主义。那是一场和平非暴力主义的抗争，与过去其他类型的抗争大相径庭。
Gandhi, your people look to you to lead them to even greater heights of glory! Can you help your people realize their great potential, to once again become the world's center of arts, culture and religion? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? = 甘地，您的人民将印度交给您，期望一个美好的将来。您能否协助印度人民，发掘出他们的潜能，再一次成为世界文艺与宗教的中心？印度的兴盛，能否历久不衰？

As the sovereign ruler of the Huns, you marched your army across Europe into Gaul, planning to extend your already impressive lands all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Your untimely death led to the quick disintegration and downfall of your empire, but your name and deeds have created an everlasting legacy for your people. = 伟大的阿提拉，伟大的勇士，匈人帝国的统治者，你们的士兵骄傲地站起来迎接你们。你和你的兄弟布莱达一起扩大了帝国的疆界，成为5世纪最强大、最可怕的力量。你向东罗马帝国的皇帝们鞠躬致意，沿着多瑙河和尼萨瓦河夺取了一个又一个王国。作为匈人的主权统治者，你们带领军队穿越欧洲进入高卢，计划将你们已经令人印象深刻的土地一直延伸到大西洋。你们的不合时宜的死亡导致了你们帝国的迅速解体和崩溃，但你们的名字和行为为你们的人民创造了一个永恒的遗产。
Fearsome General, your people call for the recreation of a new Hunnic Empire, one which will make the exploits and histories of the former seem like the faded dreaming of a dying sun. Will you answer their call to regain your rightful prominence and glory? Will you mount your steadfast steed and lead your armies to victory?

Introduction = 游戏介绍
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 您好，欢迎来到绚丽多彩的UnCiv游戏世界！\n文明游戏是复杂的，让我们通过一些简单的任务来熟悉它吧。\n这些任务是可选的，当然您也可以自己探索游戏世界！

New Game = 开始新游戏
Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = 您的第一个任务是建立首都，\n这个任务是非常重要的，因为通常情况下首都会成为你的文明最繁荣的城市。\n游戏中解锁政策、科技等带来的很多增益往往只对首都有效，所以首都的发展代表了您的文明的发达程度。
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to watch out for! = 如何选择一个合适的首都建立位置？这不是一个容易回答的问题。\n通常情况下，选择紧邻奢侈资源的位置是选择建立点的不二法则。\n奢侈资源主要包括宝石、棉花、丝绸等(这些资源在地图上用一个“笑脸”标示)，\n开发这些资源可以增加您的文明的快乐。当然，你也应该留意那些组建单位时所需要的战略资源，比如铁。城市不能建立在现有城市的3格内，这是另一项需要注意的事情！
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = 但是，城市的边界不是固定的——它会随着文化的积累慢慢扩张。\n这意味着你并不一定要把城市建在太过靠近资源的位置。\n举例来说，比如, 你需要获得战略资源铁--但悲剧的是该资源紧邻沙漠。\n您无需把城市建立在紧邻沙漠的位置。相反的，可以选择离该资源稍远而且更加富饶的地块。\n随着城市的不断繁荣发展和边界的扩张，城市将慢慢靠近该资源直至获得它。\n如果需要马上获得所需的战略资源你可以选择建城在靠近资源的位置--\n有时候这样做可能对游戏的胜利更有利，但通常情况下您都有充裕的时间选择更加合理的建立点。
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = 您的城市第一个组建的单位应当是勇士或斥候。\n我非常喜欢勇士，因为他可以用于防守，\n同时在研发“铁器”科技后只需花少量的金钱就可以把他升级为剑士。\n当您的城市位于大片森林或丘陵间时斥候是非常有效的选择，\n因为他在这些地形移动时没有移动力惩罚。\n如果您是4x游戏的行家里手，紧随第一个勇士或斥候的单位应该是移民。\n请记住：快速扩张永远是获取胜利的不二法门！

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 在游戏开始的最初几回合，\n您只需进行很少的操作。\n但随着您的文明的发展，\n很多事情必须面面俱到。

Culture and Policies = 文化与政策
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 每回合，从您的所有城市获得的文化会加到您文明的文化上。\n当您有足够的文化时, 可以推行一项社会政策，\n每项社会政策都给您一定的奖励。
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 社会政策被划分成几个分支，每个分支都有自己的子政策，\n当一个分支社会政策的所有子政策都被推行，\n会有一个额外的奖励。
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 随着每项社会政策的推行，每座城市的建立，\n推行新的社会政策时的文化花费会随之提升--所以要明智地选择!

City Expansion = 城市扩张
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 当一个城市积累了足够的文化时，城市的边界就会扩张一个临近地块。\n您无法控制它将扩张到哪个地块，但系统会优先考虑拥有资源和更高产出收益的地块。
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 每扩张一个地块都需要更多的文化，但一般来说，你的第一个城市最终会扩张到拥有一个广阔的领土范围。
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 虽然你的城市将会永远扩张下去，但你的市民只能在距离城市中心3格内的地块上工作。\n在建立新城市时应考虑到这一点。

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 随着城市规模扩大，城市的可工作地块也会变得越来越多。\n这时，你将不得不面对游戏中关于“快乐”的机制。在游戏中，快乐的产出是所有城市总和计算，\n快乐的消耗则由城市数量和人口数量决定。\n随着城市数量的增加和城市人口的增长您将会很快发现：保持你的文明始终处于快乐是一件越来越难的事。
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 此外，在未研发相关科技前您将无法建造任何能增加快乐的建筑、奇观和开发可以增加快乐的奢侈资源。\n如果您的文明处于不满，将会极大地减慢城市发展速度。\n如果文明的不满状态非常严重(顶部信息栏用一个“哭脸”标示)，\n您的部队战斗力将会有极大的减成。
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 这意味着在Unciv中很难快速扩张。\n这不是不可能的，但作为一名新玩家，您可能不应该这样做。\n那么您应该怎么做？通过建筑工人来放松、侦察并改善您拥有的土地。\n一旦您找到了一个您认为合适的地点，就要建造新的城市。

Unhappiness = 不满
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 看来你的市民很不开心!\n当他们不快乐时，你的文明将遭受许多有害的影响\n随着不快乐程度的提高\n影响会越来越严重。
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 产生不满的原因有两个:人口数和城市数，\n每座城市产生3点不满，每个市民产生1点不满。
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 有两种主要的方法来消除不满：\n为您的人民建造能增加快乐的建筑物\n或在您的境内改善奢侈资源。

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 您的文明进入了一个黄金时代!\n您的快乐每个回合都会积累，\n当快乐积累到一定数值就会开启一个黄金时代。\n在黄金时代，文化和产能产出+20%，\n每个至少产出1金钱的地块将额外提供1金钱。

Roads and Railroads = 道路与铁路
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 您已经建立了第二座城市!\n通过道路连接您的城市和首都来建立贸易路线，\n贸易路线将提供额外的金钱产出。\n请注意，道路经过的每个地块都需要1金钱的维护费，\n所以等待城市的自然发展可能更经济!

Victory Types = 获取胜利的方法
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 当您建立了两三座城市后，可能已经经过了100～150回合，\n这时您应该思考和谋划如何赢得游戏的胜利--如果此时你还没有胜利的话！
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 有四种方法能让您赢得胜利：\n - 文化胜利：完成5项社会政策分支与乌托邦计划\n - 统治胜利：成为最后存续的文明\n - 科技胜利：建造完成飞往半人马座α星的太空飞船\n - 外交胜利：建立联合国并赢得竞选。
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 总的来说，这就是Unciv的基础了——建立一个繁荣的城市，小心翼翼地扩张以维持快乐值，向您所追求的胜利条件努力。\n当然，实际的游戏内容比这丰富得多，但在学会游泳之前，可最好别踏入深水区！

Enemy City = 敌方城市
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 您已经包围了敌人的一座城市!\n当城市的耐久降至1时就可以被占领。\n只能使用近战单位占领城市。\n城市每回合会自动回复少许耐久，所以最好先使用远程单位攻击它，\n同时使用您的近战单位来保护远程单位，直到城市被占领!

Luxury Resource = 奢侈资源
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 你的领土内的奢侈资源需要建造相应的设施来开发，已开发的奢侈资源可以用来与其他文明贸易。\n您拥有的每种独一无二的奢侈资源都会给您的文明+5快乐，\n每种奢侈资源只能提供一份快乐加成，数量超过1的同种资源并不会提供更多的快乐，\n所以用它们和其他文明进行贸易吧!

Strategic Resource = 战略资源
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 你的领土内的战略资源需要建造相应的设施来开发，已开发的战略资源可以用来与其他文明贸易。\n建造/组建特定的项目(单位/建筑)时将会消耗相应的战略资源。如需要消耗1单位的马来组建1个骑手单位，\n没有马就不能组建骑手。当该单位或建筑被摧毁时，此资源将能再次使用。\n如果获取资源途径出现中断，需要该资源的单位将受到战斗力减成，直至重新获得该资源。
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 与奢侈资源不同，地图上显示的每个战略资源图标将提供多于1单位的该种资源。\n顶部信息栏显示了你拥有多少未使用的战略资源。\n在概览界面点击“资源”按钮可以查看你所拥有资源的完整信息。

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 这座城市再也不能抵抗了!\n然而，要征服城市，请使用您的近战单位占领它。

After Conquering = 占领城市的处理
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 当征服了一座城市，您可以选择解放、吞并、傀儡、甚至摧毁它。
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost, but its citizens will generate 1.5x the regular unhappiness.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = \n“解放城市”让它回归原来的文明，会使你与他们的外交关系得到巨大的提升！\n\n“吞并城市”将会给予您该城市的绝对控制权，但该城市人口产生的不满将是正常值的2倍。\n在城市内建造法庭可以使人口产生的不满降低到正常值。\n\n“傀儡城市”意味着您将无法控制该城市的产能，\n该城市将不会额外增加您研发科技和推行社会政策时的花费，但该城市人口产生的不满是正常值的1.5倍。\n可以在任何时候吞并已傀儡的城市，但已吞并的城市无法再变为傀儡状态。\n\n“摧毁城市”可以令城市人口每回合-1，人口为0时城市将完全被摧毁。\n你不能摧残一个文明的起始首都或一个宗教的圣城。

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 您遇到蛮族了！\n蛮族会不分青红皂白地攻击靠近它的每一个单位，\n所以请不要让您的移民等平民单位靠近他们，同时还要注意你的斥候！

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 您遇到了另一个文明!\n其他文明一开始是和平的，您可以和他们进行贸易，\n但是他们以后可能会选择对您宣战。

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 当您完成了阿波罗计划，可以开始在您的城市中建造飞船部件(需要相应科技)，\n来通过太空竞赛赢得科技胜利！

Injured Units = 受伤单位
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 报告大人，您的单位受伤了！\n受伤的单位会对敌方造成更少的伤害！您可能会好奇，怎么能治疗他们呢？其实很简单，您只需要在他们不受攻击的情况下原地待命，他们中的医疗兵就会开始工作了！\n在异国领土和无主的领土上，每回合会恢复15点生命值；在己方领土上，会恢复20点；在本方城市中，会恢复25点。

Workers = 工人
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 工人对您所在城市的发展至关重要，因为只有他们才能在地块上建造设施。\n设施可以提高地块的产出，\n当市民在建有设施的地块工作时，将给您的城市带来更多的收益，同时城市也会发展得更快。

Siege Units = 攻城单位
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 攻城单位对城市具有极强的毁灭力，但在进攻前必须先把它架设起来。\n您的攻城单位架设起来后，它就可以从当前的地块发起攻击，\n但是一旦它移动到其他地块，就需要重新架设。

Embarking = 陆军单位的船运
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 当一个特定的科技被研发后，你的陆地单位就可以进入水中。\n请注意，登船或下船需要花费一整个回合。
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 在水中的陆军单位是没有反伤的，并且根据你的科技时代有一个固定的防御能力。所以你最好看好你在水中的单位。\n水中的陆地远程单位不能攻击，近战单位有攻击力削弱，所有的单位视力削弱。（在研究特定的科技后可以消除这些DeBuff哦）

Idle Units = 空闲单位
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units. = 如果当前回合不想对某个单位执行任何操作，可以点击右上方“下个闲置单位”按钮来跳过该单位。\n如果一段时间内不想对其执行任何操作，可以对该单位执行“驻守”或“休眠”指令，\n系统执行“回合结束前查看闲置单位”指令时将自动跳过处于“驻守”或“休眠”状态的单位。\n如果想完全禁用“下个闲置单位”按钮，请进入“设置”菜单并将“回合结束前查看闲置单位”设置为“否”。

Contact Me = 联系我吧！
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n UnCiv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 很好!当您已经熟悉了游戏的大部分内容，\n您会发现游戏目前是不完整的，它还处于开发状态。\n不过UnCiv将永远是开源和免费的，\n这意味着您无须担心广告或付费问题。
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 您的支持将激励着我进一步完善它，\n我一定会竭尽全力、精益求精。\n感谢玩家们的支持--您们是最棒的!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 如果喜欢它，请到Play Store对它进行评价。\n如果您发现了游戏存在的问题或有什么好的意见和建议，\n请联系我！\n我的email地址：yairm210@hotmail.com，\nGitHub项目页面：https://github.com/yairm210/UnCiv。

Pillaging = 劫掠地块
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 军事单位可以劫掠地块设施，“劫掠”可以回复单位25点生命值同时将设施化为废墟。\n被“劫掠”的地块仍旧可以工作，但从地块设施获得的效果——例如基本资源加成和战略资源收益——将会消失。\n工人可以修复这些化为废墟的设施，所花费时间将比重新建造它们要少。\n劫掠特定的区块建筑（比如牧场）可以为您带来金钱的收入。

Experience = 经验
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 战斗中单位获得的经验可用于该单位的晋升。\n单位在近战攻击时获得的经验大于远程攻击时，在进攻时获得的经验大于防御时。
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 单个单位与蛮族单位战斗时最多可获得30经验值-这意味着最多2次晋升。在那之后，该单位与蛮族单位战斗将不会获得任何经验。

Combat = 战斗
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 单位和城市都会因战斗而损伤，战斗受到许多不同因素的影响。\n每个单位都有一个特定的“基础”战斗值用于战斗结算，该数值受游戏难度设置、单位拥有的晋升技能、所处的位置等因素影响。
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 当近战攻击和防御时，单位使用“战斗力”作为“基础”战斗值。\n当进行远程攻击时，单位使用“远程战斗力”作为“基础”战斗值。
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 远程攻击可以在远距离进行，这取决于单位的“攻击范围”。\n近战攻击时防御者会对攻击者造成反击伤害，远程攻击则不会。

Research Agreements = 科研协定
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 在科研协定中，你和另一个文明将共同研究科技。\n在协定结束时，你和另一个文明都将“一次性”获得大量的科研点数，这将用于你尚未研究的科技。
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 科研协定的收益取决于协定期间科研产出总量较小的那个文明——因此，选择签订科研协定对象时请慎重！

Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, don't conquer other cities and can't be traded with. = 并不是所有文明都在和你争夺胜利。城邦是无法胜利的文明，他们不能征服其他城市，也不能进行贸易。
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 相反，与城邦的外交关系取决于影响力——一个表示“城邦有多喜欢你”的数值。\n与他们的敌人战斗，解放他们的城市，或者给予他们一大笔金钱，都可以增加你对他们的影响力。
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 当影响力超过30时，根据城邦类型的不同您会获得相应的奖励。\n当影响力超过60，并且在所有文明中您对他们的影响力最高时，您将被他们视为“盟友”，可获得更多的奖励效果，同时还可以使用他们领土上的奢侈资源和战略资源。

Great People = 伟人

Removing Terrain Features = 清除地貌
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them.

Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 富士山、直布罗陀巨岩和大堡礁等自然奇观，都是独特的、无法通行的地貌，是大自然母亲的杰作，具有不同于一般地形的非凡品质。\n开发它们会为你带来大量的文化、科研、金钱或产能收益，这就是为什么需要尽快将其纳入你的帝国的原因。

But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 但要当心，传教士在国外每结束一次回合就会失去250点宗教力量。
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 这削弱了他们传播宗教的效力，如果他们的宗教力量达到0，他们就失去了信仰，消失了。
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 当你传播你的宗教信仰时，这个单位的宗教力量会增加，成为该宗教的压力。

This pressure can also be seen in the city screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 这种压力也可以在城市屏幕上看到，让你了解如果你什么都不做，城市中的宗教将如何演变。
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 圣城也为自己提供了+30的宗教压力，这使得圣城很难有效地皈依。
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 最后，在建立一个宗教之前，你创建的新城市会给你的万神殿带来200压力。
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 这样，只要你还没有建立宗教，你所有的城市都将开始追随你的万神殿。

Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = 这通常会导致城市立即皈依他们的宗教

The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 玛雅的独特能力“长历法”带来了一个副作用：
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 一旦激活，游戏的年份显示将使用玛雅符号。
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 玛雅人从我们称之为公元前3114年8月11日开始以天为单位测量时间。1天被称为K'in，20 天被称为Winal，18 Winal被称为Tun，20 Tun被称为K'atun，20 K'atun被称为B'ak'tun，20 B'ak'tun被称为Piktun，以此类推。
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = Unciv仅显示ය B'ak'tun，ඹ K'atun和ම Tun（从左到右），因为这足以近似公历年。玛雅数字很容易理解。祝你破译愉快！

Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 你的城市会定期要求得到不同的奢侈品，以满足他们对生活中新事物的渴望。
