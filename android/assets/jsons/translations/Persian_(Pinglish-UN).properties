# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that
# may not turn into valid sentences. Therefore we have the following two translations to determine
# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

 # Requires translation!
ConditionalsPlacement = 

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you! India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land. Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty. For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders. In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place. In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority. After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history! =

All hail to Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of Germany and its empire! During the ancient era, Germany was a land fragmented in several tribes but already showed great promise as the Roman Empire itself struggled to bend the Germans to its will.

O Great Sultan Suleiman, may the God bless you! You are revered for your power, wealth and generosity, and you truly deserves to be called the 'Magnificent'! The Ottoman Empire was born in Bithynia, starting as a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century, then expanded to west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your people vanquished the empire of Byzantium, annexing Turkey and the Balkans, and smartly assimilating all wonders and knowledge of the Byzantine civilization. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans added Constantinople to their empire, establishing a strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. The Empire would continue to expand for centuries reaching North Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height, but brutally disappeared in the chaos of the first world war, in early 20th century. =

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario since the ancient ages, on a land that will be later known as New York city. Long ago, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida became one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. Although not having a written language, the wise Iroquois created the Great Law of Peace, which can be considered the first established constitution. For decades, your people fought powerful enemies, such as the Huron, and then the French and English colonists. With less warriors and inferior weaponry, the Iroquois still survived and walk on the path of peace and harmony, until their way of living faded away under the crush of the newborn United States nation. =

Wars were frequent with other tribes to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zampango. In some 200 years, double-sided alliances and martial prowess made of the Aztecs the dominant power in the Central American basin, forming a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea. Alas, the empire fell under the assault of foreign devils - the Spaniards and many curses they brought with them! Wars between tribes and weaponry of doom used by the invaders made the great Aztec civilization crumble in only a few decades. =

Greetings to the wise and brave Prince William of Orange, who freed the Netherlands and gave strength to the Dutch people.

Your actions were all aimed to create one of Europe's first modern republics, the Seven United Provinces. The rebellion was the meaning of your very life and death, as it was also the cause of your assassination in 1584. But your death has given even more pride and courage to your people, to fight for liberty against any oppressors. Carved in history as the 'Father of the Fatherland', your name is a symbol of Dutch independence for eternity. =

May glory and honor always be upon you, Warrior Queen! In a time dominated by men, you successfully claimed the throne and the power, but also valiantly defied the mighty Roman Empire.

Many legions fell under your fierce attacks and you burned the city of London with your anger. While the Romans still kept ownership of your land after your final defeat, your actions nonetheless showed Rome that this land could never be fully conquered, making Nero himself consider to withdraw all troops and leaving Britain forever. =

#################### Lines from Tutorials ####################

Introduction = Mo’aarefe
 # Requires translation!
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 

 # Requires translation!
Welcome to Unciv! = 
 # Requires translation!
Because this is a complex game, there are some tutorials to help familiarize you with it. These can be disbaled in the Options -> Display menu, but please hang on if you're new here! = 
 # Requires translation!
Your first mission is to found your capital city. This is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous. Many game bonuses apply only to your capital city, and it will be the center of your empire. = 
 # Requires translation!
How do you know a city location is appropriate? Luckily, the game has already chosen a good location for you. You can settle in this place, or maybe move a turn to found on a Hill (for Production and defence) or next to a Mountain (to gain access to the Observatory building later on). = 
 # Requires translation!
You'll likely want more cities later on. For these cities, you must go and find a good place. Looking for and founding on or near Luxury resources is a good rule of thumb. = 
 # Requires translation!
Luxury resources are tiles that have things like Gems, Cotton, or Silk (indicated by a yellow background of the resource icon). These resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as Iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to keep in mind! = 
 # Requires translation!
Cities will house Citizens, which can work tiles up to 3 tiles away from the city. This means you don’t have to settle cities right on or next to good tiles. Let’s say, for example, that you want access to some Iron – but the resource is in a desert area. You don’t have to settle your city in the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands. Your city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource. You only need to settle right on top of resources if you need them immediately. = 
 # Requires translation!
The first thing coming out of your city depends on the strategy you want to follow, but the 'classic' build order is to build first two Scouts, then a Shrine, and three Settlers, and adopt Tradition, to explore the map quickly (Scouts ignore terrain cost), and to get an early Pantheon (if you're playing with religion enabled). = 
 # Requires translation!
But feel free to experiment with your own build orders! = 

 # Requires translation!
In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 

Culture and Policies = Farhang va Siyaasat haa
 # Requires translation!
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 
 # Requires translation!
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 
 # Requires translation!
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 

City Expansion = Gostaresh e Shahr
 # Requires translation!
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 
 # Requires translation!
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 

 # Requires translation!
Food is the resource fundamental to your Cities', and as a result Nation's, population and health. = 
 # Requires translation!
Every Citizen in each City consumes Food per turn. Any left over is considered Growth and is stored in the City Center. Once enough accumulates, the City Grows and a new Citizen is added. = 
 # Requires translation!
Initially your main source of Food is the City Center itself and working a surrounding tile with a Citizen. You can increase how much is generated by gaining more Citizens to work more tiles, improving the tiles so that they yield more Food, and eventually Buildings and Policies. = 
 # Requires translation!
Since a city's number of Citizens, or Population, determines how many tiles a City can work, Food is often the most important Resource. = 

 # Requires translation!
Production is the resource that lets a City Center build new things. = 
 # Requires translation!
This can be new Buildings that are added to the City Center, or new Units that can go out across the World Map to advance your Nation's goals. = 
 # Requires translation!
Everything you can build has a Production Cost. Every turn each City generates a certain amount of Production and puts it towards whatever is at the top of the Build Queue. Once the total cost is collected, the Building or Unit is built! = 
 # Requires translation!
Any excess Production after something is built is overflowed to the next thing the City builds. Up to it's total Production Cost. = 
 # Requires translation!
Since this determines how quickly you can build more stuff, your Nation's Production Capacity is crucial to it's advancement and survival. = 

 # Requires translation!
⍾Science is the resource that unlocks new and exciting Technologies for your Nation. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once you've Founded your Capital, you'll be prompted to Pick a Technology to Research. = 
 # Requires translation!
Every Technology costs an amount of ⍾Science. Every turn the ⍾Science your Nation produces is paid towards Researching your chosen Technology. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once a Technology has it's cost fully paid, you unlock the benefits for your Nation! This could be new Units, Buildings, or other advantages. Any surplus will overflow into the next Technology you pick to Research. = 
 # Requires translation!
Researching a Technology in the next Era will advance you into that Era and trigger a notification to other Nations about how amazing you are! = 
 # Requires translation!
Since new Technologies tend to give access to better Units, Buildings, and even unlock powerful new Policies, staying ahead of the competition is one of the best ways to secure your Victory! = 

 # Requires translation!
Ah Gold. The Universal Medium of Exchange. Everyone loves Gold! They say it can't buy Happiness, but nuclear submarines are almost as good. = 
 # Requires translation!
You can earn more Gold from Tiles, Resources, Improvements, and eventually Buildings, Specialists, and Trade Routes. Ancient Ruins, meeting new City-States, and Pillaging are also great sources of Gold. During a Golden Age every Tile that already yields Gold will yield an additional Gold! = 
 # Requires translation!
Gold is how you pay for Building Maintenance, Transportation Upkeep, and Unit Upkeep. If you run out of Gold, first you'll receive penalties to your ⍾Science production, then eventually your Units will start Disbanding as you can't pay their upkeep. = 
 # Requires translation!
Gold can be used to Buy Buildings and Units, helping bring up a new City or quickly build an Army. It can also buy Tiles to add to your City. It's also used to Upgrade your units from their older, obsolete forms to new, stronger versions. And investing it into a Research Agreement is a great way to convert it into ⍾Science. = 
 # Requires translation!
Gold is also very valuable in Diplomacy. You can directly Gift Gold to City-States to gain their favor. Use it to balance a Trade Deal with other Nations. Or demand every last drop after a successful war and your enemy sues for peace. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ironically, some may consider Gold to be one of the less important Resources. But it's flexible nature and importance to keep your Nation running makes it a precious thing to pay attention to. After all, everyone loves Gold. = 
 # Requires translation!
Not to be confused with the Resource of the same name, Gold Ore = 
 # Requires translation!
See also: Trade Route = 
 # Requires translation!
See also: Golden Age = 
 # Requires translation!
See also: Research Agreements = 

 # Requires translation!
As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 
 # Requires translation!
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 
 # Requires translation!
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 

Unhappiness = Naa rezaayati
 # Requires translation!
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 
 # Requires translation!
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 

 # Requires translation!
You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 

Roads and Railroads = Jaadde va Raah aahan
 # Requires translation!
Roads reduce the Movement Points required to move between two tiles connected by Roads. = 
 # Requires translation!
Railroads improve this reduction even more! = 
 # Requires translation!
This greatly improves the speed you can get Units around the map. = 
 # Requires translation!
Until you research the technology that removes it, Roads do not cross Rivers = 
 # Requires translation!
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. = 
 # Requires translation!
However, since each Road and Railroad have a Maintenance Cost, it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow and only place where needed. = 

 # Requires translation!
Trade Route = 
 # Requires translation!
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. You earn more Gold the more Population the City and your Capital has. = 
 # Requires translation!
Note that each road costs 1 Gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 Gold, so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 
 # Requires translation!
Railroads connecting a city to the Capital also provide a 25% Production Boost to the City, but not the Capital. = 
 # Requires translation!
Trade Routes are also connected over Water via certain buildings like the Harbor. As long as there is a chain that can reach the Capital, there's a Trade Route. Look for this symbol in Yellow below the City Name to mean you have an active Trade Route to your Capital. = 
 # Requires translation!
Trade Routes can get broken either by Blockades or by Removing/Pillaging the connecting Road/Railroad chain. = 
 # Requires translation!
See also City Blockade = 

 # Requires translation!
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 
 # Requires translation!
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 
 # Requires translation!
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 

Enemy City = Shahr e Doshman
 # Requires translation!
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 

 # Requires translation!
Luxury Resource = 
 # Requires translation!
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 

Strategic Resource = Manaabe’e Raahbordi
 # Requires translation!
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 

 # Requires translation!
The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 

After Conquering = Pas az Fath kardan
 # Requires translation!
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 
 # Requires translation!
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 

 # Requires translation!
Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 

Injured Units = Niroo haaye majrooh
 # Requires translation!
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 

Workers = Kaaregaraan
 # Requires translation!
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 

 # Requires translation!
Siege Units = 
 # Requires translation!
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 

 # Requires translation!
Embarking = 
 # Requires translation!
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 

 # Requires translation!
Idle Units = 
 # Requires translation!
Clicking 'Next unit' moves to the next idle unit in the queue (as listed in Overview -> Units). After issuing an order to an unit, if 'Auto Unit Cycle' in Options -> Gameplay is enabled, you will automatically select the next idle unit. = 
 # Requires translation!
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again, or command the unit to 'Skip turn'. = 
 # Requires translation!
If you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Options -> Gameplay -> Check for idle units. = 
 # Requires translation!
If you'd rather 'Next unit' cycle the units and not mark them as Done, you can change it in the Options -> Gameplay menu. = 
 # Requires translation!
You can also cycle through the idle units using the left and right triangles on the Unit Table in the lower left of the screen. Or by default using the Cycle button next to the 'Next Unit' button. = 

Contact Me = Ertebaat baa man
 # Requires translation!
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n Unciv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 
 # Requires translation!
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 
 # Requires translation!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 

Pillaging = Ghaarat kardan
 # Requires translation!
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 

Experience = Tajrobe
 # Requires translation!
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 

 # Requires translation!
Combat = 
 # Requires translation!
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 

 # Requires translation!
Embassies = 
 # Requires translation!
Establishing an embassy in other players' Capital city shows the location of their Capital, likewise other players who establish an embassy in your Capital can see location of your Capital. = 
 # Requires translation!
Embassies thus allow Spies to be placed in another players' Capital City if Espionage is enabled. = 
 # Requires translation!
Mutual embassies are required to allow trading open borders and to sign Research Agreement and Defensive Pact. = 
 # Requires translation!
Declaring war on another player or denouncing them will remove embassies from both players' Capitals. You will have to re-establish them to use their effect. = 
 # Requires translation!
Re-establishing an embasy after denounciation from either side becomes available next turn, while re-establishing them when at war requires peacy treaty. = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when accepting embassy from other players because they can spy on your capital, or worse may start planning to attack you. = 
 # Requires translation!
Embassies are available using the Gods and Kings ruleset. = 

 # Requires translation!
Open Borders from other player and vice versa allow units to freely pass trough their territoy. = 
 # Requires translation!
They also let Missionaries to enter other players' territory without suffering attrition. = 
 # Requires translation!
Open Borders expire depending on game speed and are canceled upon Declaration of War, the closure however takes effect only after war ends and need to be traded again. = 
 # Requires translation!
You gain diplomatic boost with other AI player if you both have Open Borders to each other = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when giving Open Borders because other player may settle a City near your lands in an area you are planning to use, they may also use your territory to attack your friends or City State allies. = 
 # Requires translation!
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Open Borders can be traded. = 
 # Requires translation!
See also: Embassies = 

 # Requires translation!
Research Agreements = 
 # Requires translation!
In Research Agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of ⍾Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 
 # Requires translation!
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 
 # Requires translation!
Note that before you can invest in a research agreement, you must have a Declaraction of Friendship, both Nations need the required Technology, and both Nations need enough Gold on hand for the agreement. = 
 # Requires translation!
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Research Agreement can be signed. = 

 # Requires translation!
Defensive Pacts = 
 # Requires translation!
Defensive pacts allow you and another civ to protect one another from aggressors.\nOnce the defensive pact is signed, you will be drawn into their future defensive wars, just as they will be drawn into your future defensive wars. Declaring war on any Civ will remove all of your defensive pacts. You will have to re-sign them to use their effect. = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when signing defensive pacts because they can bring you into wars that you might not want to be in. = 
 # Requires translation!
The AI is very careful and will not accept defensive pacts with less than 80 influence. = 
 # Requires translation!
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Defensive Pact can be signed. = 

 # Requires translation!
Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, can't be traded with, and instead confer certain bonuses to friendly civilizations. = 
 # Requires translation!
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 

 # Requires translation!
While working the land is good, eventually your Citizens will want to Specialize. = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain Buildings will also provide Specialist Slots. These slots will show up in the Citizen Management within the City Screen under Specialists. Each slot can be filled with a Citizen which will then become a Specialist. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each Specialist will generate a certain amount of yield as indicated to the right of the available slots. = 
 # Requires translation!
While these are a great way to specialize the yield production of a City outside of the surrounding Tile Yields, Specialists have an additional value. Each one also generates Great Person Points each turn. With enough of them, a new Great Person will join your Nation. = 
 # Requires translation!
See also Great People = 

Great People = Ensaan haaye Bozorg
 # Requires translation!
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
Alternatively, the Great Person points breakdown per city can be viewed in each City Screen (see UI Tips article). = 
 # Requires translation!
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 
 # Requires translation!
See also Specialists = 

 # Requires translation!
Removing Terrain Features = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = 

 # Requires translation!
Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, ⍾Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 

Keyboard = Kibord
 # Requires translation!
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = 
 # Requires translation!
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: =

 # Requires translation!
⑫: This button closes the selected unit/city info pane. = 
 # Requires translation!
⑬: This pane appears when you order a unit to attack an enemy. On top are attacker and defender with their respective base strengths. = 
 # Requires translation!
⑭: Below that are strength bonuses or penalties and health bars projecting before / after the attack. = 
 # Requires translation!
⑮: The Attack Button - let blood flow! = 
 # Requires translation!
⑯: The minimap shows an overview over the world, with known cities, terrain and fog of war. Clicking will position the main map. =

 # Requires translation!
ⓑ: The ♪Culture icon shows accumulated ♪Culture and ♪Culture needed for the next policy - in this case, the exclamation mark tells us a next policy can be enacted. Clicking is another way to the policies manager. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓒ: Your known strategic resources are displayed here with the available (usage already deducted) number - click to go to the resources overview screen. = 
 # Requires translation!

 # Requires translation!
ⓔ: The ⍾Science icon shows the number of ⍾Science points produced per turn. Clicking leads to the technology tree. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓕ: Number of turns played with translation into calendar years. Click to see the victory overview. = 
 # Requires translation!
ⓖ: The number of gold coins in your treasury and income. Clicks lead to the Stats overview screen. =

 # Requires translation!
ⓩ: And this is the red targeting circle that led to the attack pane back under ⑬. = 
 # Requires translation!
What you don't see: The phone/tablet's back button will pop the question whether you wish to leave Unciv and go back to Real Life. On desktop versions, you can use the ESC key. = 

 # Requires translation!
When at later stages of the game, you might have a lot of units but only a little to do. To help you we have implemented an AutoPlay feature that lets you use the AI to play part or all of your turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
To enable AutoPlay, go to options and open the AutoPlay tab and press "Show AutoPlay button". = 
 # Requires translation!
Clicking on the AutoPlay button opens a popup menue for choosing to AutoPlay parts or all of your turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Clicking Start AutoPlay in the pop-up menue or long pressing the AutoPlay button begins the multi-turn AutoPlay. This will play your next turns as if you were an AI. = 
 # Requires translation!
To cancel multi-turn AutoPlay you can press the AutoPlay button, next turn button or open the options menue. = 
 # Requires translation!
Multi-turn AutoPlay is not advised on harder difficulty levels as your AI will not play better against an AI with modifiers. = 
 # Requires translation!
Multi-turn AutoPlay for multiplayer is not yet supported. = 

 # Requires translation!
After building a shrine, your civilization will start generating ☮Faith. = 
 # Requires translation!
When enough ☮Faith has been generated, you will be able to found a pantheon. = 
 # Requires translation!
A pantheon will provide a small bonus for your civilization that will apply to all cities that have it as a majority religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = 
 # Requires translation!
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = 
 # Requires translation!
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = 
 # Requires translation!
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = 

Beliefs = Baavar haa
 # Requires translation!
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = 
 # Requires translation!
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = 

Religion inside cities = Din daroon e shahr haa
 # Requires translation!
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = 
 # Requires translation!
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = 
 # Requires translation!
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the City Screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = 
 # Requires translation!
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = 
 # Requires translation!
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = 
 # Requires translation!
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
Spreading Religion = 
 # Requires translation!
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = 
 # Requires translation!
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 
 # Requires translation!
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = 
 # Requires translation!
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = 
 # Requires translation!
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 
 # Requires translation!
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 
 # Requires translation!
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = 
 # Requires translation!
This pressure can also be seen in the City Screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 
 # Requires translation!
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 
 # Requires translation!
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 
 # Requires translation!
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 

 # Requires translation!
Inquisitors = 
 # Requires translation!
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = 
 # Requires translation!
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = 
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is unaffected. = 

 # Requires translation!
The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 
 # Requires translation!
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 
 # Requires translation!
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = 

 # Requires translation!
Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 
 # Requires translation!
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = 
 # Requires translation!
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 
 # Requires translation!
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = 

 # Requires translation!
Air Combat and Interception = 
 # Requires translation!
Air Combat is very similar to normal Combat, with a few wrinkles. Damage is still dealt using the same equations based on the relative Strength of the Attacking and Defending Unit. = 
 # Requires translation!
However, before the Attacker and Defender fight, there is an added combat phase called Interception. If there is any unit with Interception Range that covers the target attacked tile, then it will attempt to Intercept the Attacking Air Unit. If multiple units can Intercept, the one with higher Intercept chance does it. = 
 # Requires translation!
Generally Land/Naval Units have an Intercept Range of 2 Tiles, and Air Units have an Intercept Range of their Attack Range. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ground and Naval Units don't require movement points to Intercept, just Attacks. Air Units cannot have moved nor attacked in the preceding turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
The Intercepting Unit rolls to see if it hits. Whether it hits or not costs an Attack, and most units (without Promotions) can only Attack Once per Nation's Turn. It does NOT cost Movement Points, but Air Units that have used their Movement cannot Intercept between turns. = 
 # Requires translation!
If the Intercepting Unit Hits, it deals damage according to the Combat Strength calculation to the Attacking Air Unit, potentially with any Strength Bonuses that apply to Interception. It does not receive damage from the Attacking Air Unit. = 
 # Requires translation!
After Interception resolves, the Attacking Air Unit and the Defending Unit in the targeted tile do Combat as normal, with damage dealt to both sides. = 
 # Requires translation!
To help deal with Interceptions, see Air Sweeps. = 

 # Requires translation!
Air Sweeps = 
 # Requires translation!
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = 
 # Requires translation!
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = 
 # Requires translation!
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = 
 # Requires translation!
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = 
 # Requires translation!
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = 

 # Requires translation!
Fortify, Guard, Withdraw = 
 # Requires translation!
Most Land units have the ability to Fortify. As they spend time without moving, they will slowly gain a Fortification Bonus to their Combat Strength representing digging in and preparing in case of an attack. = 
 # Requires translation!
Some units have the ability to Withdraw before a melee attack is struck. However, perhaps you wish for them to stand their ground to protect a particular tile. If you do, then give them the Guard command and they will stay fixed until they die or you give them fresh orders. = 
 # Requires translation!
This is NOT the same as Fortify but they will still gain the Fortification Bonus. They will simply not utilize their Withdraw ability. Fortified units with the Withdraw ability will try to flee when attacked. = 

 # Requires translation!
City Tile Blockade = 
 # Requires translation!
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = 
 # Requires translation!
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = 

 # Requires translation!
City Blockade = 
 # Requires translation!
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = 

Spies! = Jaasoos haa!
The first time a civ reaches the Renaissance era each nation gets one spy. Every time a civ reaches an era afterwards they get one more spy. = Har tamaddoni ke baraaye avvalin baar be asre ronesaans beresad yek jaasoos be har mellat ezaafe mishavad. Har baar tamaddoni be asre ba’di beresad aanhaa yek jaasoose digar migirand.
 # Requires translation!
Spies can be sent out to foreign cities to steal technology, rigging elections or stage coups. Place them in your own cities to do counter-intelligence work. = 
 # Requires translation!
Only one spy per civ is allowed in each city. Spies that are not in any city are on vacation in your spy hideout. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies set up in cities of major civilizations will try to steal technology at a rate which is based off of the science production in the city. Succeeding to steal technology will level up your spy. Failing to succeed will level up the defending spy if it is present. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies set in city-states will try to rig the elections in order to gain influence and reduce the influence of other civilizations. Only one spy partaking in rigging the election can win. = 
 # Requires translation!
A spy that is rigging an election in a city-state may also stage a coup. The likelihood of success for the coup depends on your relative influence to the current ally of the city-state, your spy level, and the level of the spy that the current ally has in the city-state if present. Succeeding a coup will make you their new ally and reduce the influence of all other civs. Failing a coup will kill your spy and level up the defending spy if present. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies that are set up in your own cities will be conducting counter-intelligence. They reduce the success chance of other spies trying to steal your technology. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies at a higher rank have a higher chance of success. The max rank a spy can reach is rank 3. After a spy is killed it will revive after a certain amount of turns back at rank 1. =

Differences from Civilization V = 
 # Requires translation!
Production Focus\nIn Civilization V, the Food yield in a city is calculated first, then population grows by consuming stored food (growth), then production is calculated, and so on one by one the other stats are calculated. Thus, citizens can produce yields in the same turn as they are born. The city focus is set to Production to assign the newborn citizen to a hill so they'll contribute Production, and then manually reassigned to a growth tile on the next turn. Alternatively, you can set city focus to Gold (e.g. with Cerro de Potosi), Faith (e.g. with Mount Sinai) or whatever gains the most yields. In Unciv, citizens only start producing yields on the next turn, so you can ignore this whole concept. = 
 # Requires translation!
Science Queueing\nIn Civilization V, Science yield is calculated after production, so if you finish an item and have Science (or Gold) queued as a perpetual construction, the Production overflow from item will be converted into Science (or Gold), but the Production is not consumed, as this will only happen again on the next turn. By immediately swapping out your perpetual construction for an item on the next turn, you'll get this Science (or Gold) for free. This doesn't apply to Unciv, so don't bother. = 
 # Requires translation!
Double Aqueducts\nIn Civilization V, the game sells existing copies of the building for you before providing a free copy of the building. So, if you build an aqueduct in a city, and then in the turn of adopting Tradition Complete you sell a cheap building (e.g a shrine) beforehand, the game is unable to sell more than 1 building per turn, and thus you'll keep your aqueduct, together with the new free aqueduct. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Legalism Oxford\nIn Civilization V, national wonders such as Oxford University are considered culture buildings, so you can get them for free with Legalism. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Roads and Forts\nIn Civilization V, you can't use roads and forts in enemy territory. In Unciv, you can use them, so instead of mindlessly constructing them everywhere when at war, you need to decide if and when they'll benefit you more than your opponents. = 
 # Requires translation!
Citizen Conversion\nIn Civilization V, a citizen is born religious if the parent city is already converted. This is not the case in Unciv, which can lead to temporary deconversion of a city when it grows. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unassigned Citizens\nIn Civilization V, unassigned citizens are considered specialists, and subject to the same type of bonuses (e.g. Korea's ability). It can be worthwhile to leave citizens unassigned, instead of being assigned to a tile. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Settler Construction\nIn Civilization V, cities can't starve when constructing settlers, so you can assign all citizens to production tiles and none to food tiles. In Unciv, citizens keep consuming two food per turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Water Melee Attack\nAs result of a Discord poll, Water Melee units can attack military land units on the shore, unlike in Civilization V. = 
 # Requires translation!
Tile improvements\nIn Civilzation V, workers start working on an improvement-under-construction at the beginning of movement. Unciv changes this, to allow players to assign workers to tiles, and then reconsider and change improvement or move them elsewhere. = 
 # Requires translation!
Forest and Jungle Visibility\nIn Unciv, forests and jungles are visible 1 tile outside visibility range. In Civilization V, this is the behaviour of hills and mountains, but not of forests and jungles, yet jungle and forest can block hills, and hill + forest can block mountain, indicating they're on the same elevation. This is considered to be a bug in the otherwise well-structured visibility logic in Civilization V. = 
 # Requires translation!
City razing\nIn Civilization V, the player can never raze any of the cities he/she founded. Not applicable to Unciv. = 

 # Requires translation!
Founding Cities\nThe Settler is a unit that can found a new city. You can build a Settler unit in a city with at least 2 population, and then move them to a good location to found a new city. This will usually be your main way of acquiring more cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Food conversion to Production\nDuring the construction of a Settler, the city will not grow. Instead, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and from there on every 4th, excess Food (Growth) is converted into Production, with the rest of the excess Food being lost. =
