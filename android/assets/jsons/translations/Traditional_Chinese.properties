# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that
# may not turn into valid sentences. Therefore we have the following two translations to determine
# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

ConditionalsPlacement = before

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

With its Great Army, reputed as one of the greatest in the History, France fought gloriously all surrounding enemies, but eventually fell against the coalition of other European powers. = 拿破侖一世，法國第一執政官和皇帝萬歲！在鎮壓了數百年君主製的輝煌革命之後，法蘭西民族作為共和國屹立於歐洲中心，並打算通過外交或戰爭將其理想輸出到整個歐洲大陸。法國首都巴黎比以往任何時候都更是世界文化、藝術和文學的中心。憑借其歷史上最偉大的軍隊之一，法國光榮地抗擊了所有周邊敵人，但最終敗給了其他歐洲大國的聯盟。

And by the will of God, the caliphate reached its full power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia, to even surpass the Great Roman Empire.

Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you! India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land. Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty. For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders. In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place. In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority. After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history! = 我們向印度的偉大領袖，智慧的甘地致敬！印度是世界上最古老的國家之一，擁有10000年的歷史，建立在精神和宗教之上，因為世界上三大宗教——印度教、佛教和耆那教——都誕生在這片神聖的土地上。印度社會的各個方面都尊崇藝術、音樂和色彩，既展現出巨大的財富，也揭示出極度的貧困。幾個世紀以來，印度一直飽受本地王國之間的爭鬥和抵禦外來侵略者的困擾。公元12世紀，穆斯林突厥人試圖征服印度，隨後蒙古人取而代之。17世紀初，印度仍然四分五裂，被英國人及其外交手段和技術優勢所殖民。經過兩個世紀的英國統治，印度民族主義覺醒，而您，偉大的甘地，領導了一場歷史上從未有過的和平而勝利的反抗！
Gandhi, your people ask again to be led on the path of freedom. Under protection of Ganesha and Surya, can India accomplish its great potential? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? = 甘地，您的人民再次請求您引領他們走向自由之路。在象頭神和太陽神的庇護下，印度能否實現其巨大潛力？您的新帝國會在歷史的長河中閃耀嗎？

All hail to Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of Germany and its empire!

The German people are creative, intelligent, industrious and proven to be talented warriors through history. Despite great catastrophes and failures in the first half of the 20th century, Germany can always rely on its people will and strength to be among the greatest and powerful nations in the world. = 向德國及其帝國的首位首相奧托·馮·俾斯麥致敬！在古代，德國是一片分裂成幾個部落的土地，但已經顯示出巨大的希望，因為羅馬帝國本身也在努力使德國人屈服於它的意誌。德國作為一個國家，是在神聖羅馬帝國的廢墟上慢慢建立起來的，在1871年對法國和拿破侖三世的輝煌勝利後，德國終於實現了統一。德國人民富有創造力、智慧、勤勞，並且在歷史上被證明是有才華的戰士。盡管在20世紀上半葉遭遇了巨大的災難和失敗，但德國始終可以依靠其人民的意誌和力量，成為世界上最偉大、最強大的國家之一。

The Empire would continue to expand for centuries reaching North Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height, but brutally disappeared in the chaos of the first world war, in early 20th century. = 哦，偉大的蘇丹蘇萊曼，願上帝保佑你！你因力量、財富和慷慨而受到尊敬，你確實配得上「輝煌」的稱號！奧斯曼帝國誕生於比提尼亞，12世紀時只是安納托利亞東部的一個小國，然後向西擴張到安納托利亞。在接下來的一個世紀裏，你們的人民征服了拜占庭帝國，吞並了土耳其和巴爾幹半島，並巧妙地吸收了拜占庭文明的所有奇跡和知識。15世紀中葉，奧斯曼人將君士坦丁堡納入其帝國版圖，在歐洲和中東之間建立了戰略聯系。幾個世紀以來，帝國繼續擴張，在其鼎盛時期達到了北非、中東和東歐，但在20世紀初的第一次世界大戰的混亂中慘烈消失。

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario since the ancient ages, on a land that will be later known as New York city. Long ago, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida became one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. Although not having a written language, the wise Iroquois created the Great Law of Peace, which can be considered the first established constitution. For decades, your people fought powerful enemies, such as the Huron, and then the French and English colonists. With less warriors and inferior weaponry, the Iroquois still survived and walk on the path of peace and harmony, until their way of living faded away under the crush of the newborn United States nation. = 向你問好，尊貴的海華沙，強大的易洛魁部落的領袖！自古以來，你的族人就居住在偉大而神聖的安大略湖畔，這片土地後來被稱為紐約市。很久以前，塞內卡、奧農達加、莫霍克、凱尤加和奧利達這五個部落合並為一個國家，即豪德諾索尼，也就是易洛魁。雖然沒有書面語言，但聰明的易洛魁人製定了《大和平法》，這可以被視為第一部成文憲法。幾十年來，你們的人民與強大的敵人作戰，如休倫人，然後是法國和英國殖民者。盡管戰士人數較少，武器裝備較差，但易洛魁人仍然頑強生存，並繼續走和平與和諧的道路，直到他們的生活方式在新生的美國國家的沖擊下逐漸消失。
Great Sachem Hiawatha, do you hear the complaints of your people? Can you light the path leading to the ancient Iroquois union? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? = 偉大的酋長海華沙，你聽到你的人民的抱怨了嗎？你能照亮通往古代易洛魁聯盟的道路嗎？你的新帝國會在歷史的長河中閃耀嗎？

Great King Darius of Persia, the heaven casts its light upon you! Persian people are strong and wise, as their leader. In old ages, the great Persian king Cyrus fought back the mighty Median empire and finally destroyed the Medes in 550 BC. Cunning diplomacy and military achievements helped then to conquer the wealthy Lydia and the powerful Babylon, Cyrus' son conquering the eternal Egypt some years later. At the height of its power, the Persian Empire reached the shores of Macedonia, at the very door of the upstart Greek city-states. Persia would have prospered for centuries if Alexander of Macedon hadn't brutally destroyed the great empire in one violent strike. = 波斯偉大的大流士國王，上天將光輝照耀於你！波斯人民堅強而智慧，正如他們的領袖一樣。在古代，偉大的波斯國王居魯士反擊了強大的米底亞帝國，最終在公元前550年將其摧毀。狡猾的外交手腕和軍事成就幫助他們征服了富有的呂底亞和強大的巴比倫，幾年後，居魯士的兒子征服了永恒的埃及。在其權力的鼎盛時期，波斯帝國到達了馬其頓的海岸，就在新興的希臘城邦的大門口。如果不是馬其頓的亞歷山大在一次猛烈的打擊中殘酷地摧毀了這個偉大的帝國，波斯本可以繁榮幾個世紀。

With cunning diplomacy and brilliant warfare, you swept your enemies one after another, creating the greatest empire ever seen, reducing Roman or Greek conquests to minor achievements. = 哦，偉大的鐵木真，你是不可戰勝的蒙古帝國的領袖！僅憑你的名字，就足以使城市崩潰，而強大的蒙古騎兵的沖鋒聲則會讓你的敵人逃之夭夭！哦，偉大的可汗！一旦北亞聯合成為一個強大的民族，組建出世界上有史以來最偉大的軍隊之一，你嫻熟的騎兵弓箭手就在短短幾年內征服了中國的大部分地區、東亞，甚至向西攻至歐洲的大門。你憑借狡猾的外交手腕和輝煌的戰績，一個又一個地掃除了敵人，建立了有史以來最偉大的帝國，相比之下，羅馬或希臘的征服都顯得微不足道。
Divine Temuujin, battles and conquests run through the veins of the Mongols. Are you ready to shatter the will of your enemies? Will your cavalry ride in the steppes once again and strike as lightning and thunder? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? = 神聖的鐵木真，戰鬥和征服流淌在蒙古人的血脈之中。你準備好粉碎敵人的意誌了嗎？你的騎兵將再次馳騁在草原上，像閃電和雷霆一樣發動攻擊嗎？你的新帝國會在歷史的長河中閃耀嗎？

O divine Montezuma, your people welcome you! May your magnificence inspire all living things! The mighty Aztecs were nomads until the 12th century, when they choose to settle in the mesa central, which would later be called Mexico. Wars were frequent with other tribes to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zampango. In some 200 years, double-sided alliances and martial prowess made of the Aztecs the dominant power in the Central American basin, forming a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea.

Carved in history as the 'Father of the Fatherland', your name is a symbol of Dutch independence for eternity. = 向睿智而勇敢的奧蘭治威廉王子致敬，是您解放了荷蘭，賦予了荷蘭人民力量。1568年，您領導了一場反抗西班牙統治的起義，為您的人民爭取自由，從而開始了八十年戰爭。您的所有行動都是為了建立歐洲最早的現代共和國之一——七省聯合共和國。起義是您一生的意義，也是您在1584年被暗殺的原因。但您的死為您的人民帶來了更多的驕傲和勇氣，激勵他們為自由而反抗任何壓迫者。您被歷史銘記為「國父」，您的名字永遠是荷蘭獨立的象征。

Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 您好，歡迎來到絢麗多彩的Unciv遊戲世界！\n文明遊戲是複雜的，讓我們通過一些簡單的任務來熟悉它吧。\n這些任務是可選的，當然您也可以自己探索遊戲世界！

Welcome to Unciv! = 歡迎來到Unciv！
Because this is a complex game, there are some tutorials to help familiarize you with it. These can be disbaled in the Options -> Display menu, but please hang on if you're new here! = 這款遊戲有點復雜，所以我們做了教程來幫助你熟悉遊戲。這些教程可以在選項 -> 顯示菜單中禁用，但如果你是萌新，請堅持走一遍教程！
Your first mission is to found your capital city. This is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous. Many game bonuses apply only to your capital city, and it will be the center of your empire. = 你的首要任務是建立你的首都。因為你的首都可能會成為你最繁榮的城市。許多遊戲獎勵只適用於你的首都，它將是你的帝國中心。
How do you know a city location is appropriate? Luckily, the game has already chosen a good location for you. You can settle in this place, or maybe move a turn to found on a Hill (for Production and defence) or next to a Mountain (to gain access to the Observatory building later on). = 你怎麽知道一個城市的位置是否合適？遊戲已經為你選擇了一個好位置。你可以在這個位置定居，或者移動一回合去建立在山上(為了生產和防禦)或者靠近山脈(以便稍後獲得天文臺建築)。
You'll likely want more cities later on. For these cities, you must go and find a good place. Looking for and founding on or near Luxury resources is a good rule of thumb. = 你以後可能想要更多的城市。對於這些城市，你必須去尋找一個好地方，盡量建立在奢侈品資源上或附近。
Luxury resources are tiles that have things like Gems, Cotton, or Silk (indicated by a yellow background of the resource icon). These resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as Iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to keep in mind! = 奢侈品資源是那些有寶石、棉花或絲綢等資源的地塊(黃色背景的資源圖標)。這些資源使你的文明感到快樂。你還應該留意建造單位所需的資源，比如鐵。註意，城市不能建在現有城市3格範圍內！
 # Requires translation!
Cities will house Citizens, which can work tiles up to 3 tiles away from the city. This means you don’t have to settle cities right on or next to good tiles. Let’s say, for example, that you want access to some Iron – but the resource is in a desert area. You don’t have to settle your city in the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands. Your city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource. You only need to settle right on top of resources if you need them immediately. = 
The first thing coming out of your city depends on the strategy you want to follow, but the 'classic' build order is to build first two Scouts, then a Shrine, and three Settlers, and adopt Tradition, to explore the map quickly (Scouts ignore terrain cost), and to get an early Pantheon (if you're playing with religion enabled). = 你的城市首先產出的東西取決於你想遵循的策略，但「經典」的建造順序是先建造兩個斥候，然後是神社，接著是三個移民，並采納傳統政策，以快速探索地圖(偵察兵忽略地形成本)，並盡早獲得一個萬神殿(如果你啟用了宗教)。
But feel free to experiment with your own build orders! = 但請隨意嘗試建造順序！

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 在遊戲開始的最初幾回合，\n您只需進行很少的操作。\n但隨著您的文明的發展，\n很多事情必須面面俱到。

Culture and Policies = 文化與政策
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 文化可以通過建設文化建築或奇觀、推行社會政策等積累。\n當您有足夠的文化時, 可以推行一項社會政策，\n每項社會政策都給您一定的獎勵。
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 社會政策被劃分成幾個分支，每個分支都有自己的子政策，\n當一個分支社會政策的所有子政策都被推行，\n會有一個額外的獎勵。
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 隨著每項社會政策的推行，每座城市的建立，\n推行新的社會政策時的文化花費會隨之提升--所以要明智地選擇!

City Expansion = 城市擴張
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 當一個城市積累了足夠的文化時，城市的邊界就會擴張一個臨近地塊。\n您無法控制它將擴張到哪個地塊，但系統會優先考慮擁有資源和更高產出收益的地塊。
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 每擴張一個地塊都需要更多的文化，但一般來說，你的第一個城市最終會擴張到擁有一個廣闊的領土範圍。
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 雖然你的城市將會永遠擴張下去，但你的市民只能在距離城市中心3格內的地塊上工作。\n在建立新城市時應考慮到這一點。

Food is the resource fundamental to your Cities', and as a result Nation's, population and health. = 食物是維持城市和國家人口與健康的基本資源。
Every Citizen in each City consumes Food per turn. Any left over is considered Growth and is stored in the City Center. Once enough accumulates, the City Grows and a new Citizen is added. = 每個城市的每個人口每回合都會消耗食物。余糧被視為增長，並儲存在市中心。一旦積累足夠，城市將會增長一個新人口。
Initially your main source of Food is the City Center itself and working a surrounding tile with a Citizen. You can increase how much is generated by gaining more Citizens to work more tiles, improving the tiles so that they yield more Food, and eventually Buildings and Policies. = 您早期的主要食物來源是城市中心本身和用人口開墾周圍的地塊。您可以通過增加更多的市民來開墾更多的地塊，改善地塊以獲得更多的食物，並最終通過建築和政策來增加食物產量。
Since a city's number of Citizens, or Population, determines how many tiles a City can work, Food is often the most important Resource. = 由於城市的人口決定了城市可以開墾多少地塊，食物通常是最重要的資源。

Production is the resource that lets a City Center build new things. = 產能是讓市中心建造新事物的資源。
This can be new Buildings that are added to the City Center, or new Units that can go out across the World Map to advance your Nation's goals. = 這些新事物可以是添加到市中心的新建築，或者是可以在世界地圖上行動以推進國家目標的新單位。
Everything you can build has a Production Cost. Every turn each City generates a certain amount of Production and puts it towards whatever is at the top of the Build Queue. Once the total cost is collected, the Building or Unit is built! = 你能建造的每樣東西都有一個生產成本。每回合每個城市會產生一定數量的產能，並將其投入到建造隊列頂部的項目中。一旦總成本被收集完成，建築或單位就會被建造出來！
Any excess Production after something is built is overflowed to the next thing the City builds. Up to it's total Production Cost. = 建造完成後任何多余的產能都會溢出到城市建造的下一個項目，直到其總生產成本為止。
Since this determines how quickly you can build more stuff, your Nation's Production Capacity is crucial to it's advancement and survival. = 由於這決定了你能多快地建造更多東西，國家的生產能力對其發展和生存至關重要。

⍾Science is the resource that unlocks new and exciting Technologies for your Nation. = ⍾科研是為您的國家解鎖新科技的資源。
Once you've Founded your Capital, you'll be prompted to Pick a Technology to Research. = 一旦您建立了首都，系統會提示您選擇一項技術進行研究。
Every Technology costs an amount of ⍾Science. Every turn the ⍾Science your Nation produces is paid towards Researching your chosen Technology. = 每項技術都有一定的⍾科研成本。每回合您的國家產生的⍾科研將用於研究您選擇的技術。
Once a Technology has it's cost fully paid, you unlock the benefits for your Nation! This could be new Units, Buildings, or other advantages. Any surplus will overflow into the next Technology you pick to Research. = 一旦一項技術的成本完全支付，您就會為您的國家解鎖這些科技帶來的好處！這些好處可能是新的單位、建築或其他優勢。任何剩余的科研點數會溢出到您選擇研究的下一項科技中。
Researching a Technology in the next Era will advance you into that Era and trigger a notification to other Nations about how amazing you are! = 研究下一時代的科技將使您進入該時代，並向其他國家發送通知，告知他們您的卓越成就！
Since new Technologies tend to give access to better Units, Buildings, and even unlock powerful new Policies, staying ahead of the competition is one of the best ways to secure your Victory! = 由於新技科技往往可以提供更好的單位、建築，甚至解鎖強大的新政策，領先於競爭對手是確保您獲得勝利的最佳方式之一！

Ah Gold. The Universal Medium of Exchange. Everyone loves Gold! They say it can't buy Happiness, but nuclear submarines are almost as good. = 黃金是通用的交換媒介。每個人都喜歡黃金！有錢不一定幸福，但沒錢一定不幸福。
You can earn more Gold from Tiles, Resources, Improvements, and eventually Buildings, Specialists, and Trade Routes. Ancient Ruins, meeting new City-States, and Pillaging are also great sources of Gold. During a Golden Age every Tile that already yields Gold will yield an additional Gold! = 您可以通過地塊、資源、改良改良，以及最終的建築、專家和貿易路線來賺取更多黃金。古代遺跡、遇見新的城邦和掠奪也是黃金的絕佳來源。在黃金時代，每個已經產出黃金的地塊將額外產出黃金！
Gold is how you pay for Building Maintenance, Transportation Upkeep, and Unit Upkeep. If you run out of Gold, first you'll receive penalties to your ⍾Science production, then eventually your Units will start Disbanding as you can't pay their upkeep. = 黃金用於支付建築維護、運輸維護和單位維護費用。如果您用完了黃金，首先您的⍾科科研產量將受到懲罰，最終您的單位將開始解散，因為您無法支付他們的維護費用。
Gold can be used to Buy Buildings and Units, helping bring up a new City or quickly build an Army. It can also buy Tiles to add to your City. It's also used to Upgrade your units from their older, obsolete forms to new, stronger versions. And investing it into a Research Agreement is a great way to convert it into ⍾Science. = 黃金可以用來購買建築和單位，幫助建立新的城市或快速建立軍隊。它還可以購買地塊以擴展您的城市。它還可以用來升級您的單位，從舊的、過時的形式升級到新的、更強的版本。將其投資於科研協定是將其轉化為⍾科研的好方法。
Gold is also very valuable in Diplomacy. You can directly Gift Gold to City-States to gain their favor. Use it to balance a Trade Deal with other Nations. Or demand every last drop after a successful war and your enemy sues for peace. = 黃金在外交中也非常有價值。您可以直接贈送黃金給城邦以獲得他們的好感。用它來平衡與其他國家的貿易協議。或者在成功的戰爭後要求對方在求和時交出每一滴黃金。
Ironically, some may consider Gold to be one of the less important Resources. But it's flexible nature and importance to keep your Nation running makes it a precious thing to pay attention to. After all, everyone loves Gold. = 諷刺的是，有些人可能認為黃金是較不重要的資源之一。但它的靈活性和維持國家運轉的重要性使其成為值得關註的寶貴資源。畢竟，每個人都喜歡黃金。
Not to be confused with the Resource of the same name, Gold Ore = 不要與同名資源黃金(奢侈品)混淆

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 隨著城市規模擴大，城市的可工作地塊也會變得越來越多。\n這時，你將不得不面對遊戲中關於“快樂”的機制。在遊戲中，快樂的產出是所有城市總和計算，\n快樂的消耗則由城市數量和人口數量決定。\n隨著城市數量的增加和城市人口的增長您將會很快發現：保持你的文明始終處於快樂是一件越來越難的事。
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 此外，在未研發相關科技前您將無法建造任何能增加快樂的建築、奇觀和開發可以增加快樂的奢侈資源。\n如果您的文明處於不滿，將會極大地減慢城市發展速度。\n如果文明的不滿狀態非常嚴重(頂部資訊欄用一個“哭臉”標示)，\n您的部隊戰鬥力將會有極大的減成。
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 這意味著在 Unciv中快速擴張是非常困難的。\n雖然這並非不可能，但作為一個新玩家，你可能不應該這樣做。\n那你應該怎麼做？放鬆、偵察和通過建築工人來改善你所擁有的土地。\n只有在找到你認為合適的地點後才建造新城市。

Unhappiness = 不滿
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 看來你的公民們很不開心！\n在不開心的同時，你們的文明會遭受許多不利影響，隨著不開心的程度越來越高，嚴重程度也會越來越高。
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 產生不滿的原因有兩個:人口數和城市數，\n每座城市產生3點不滿，每個市民產生1點不滿。
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 有 2 種主要方法可以對抗不快樂：\n 為您的人民建造增加快樂值的建築\n或增加您境內的奢侈品資源。

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 您的文明進入了一個黃金時代!\n您的快樂每個回合都會積累，\n當快樂積累到一定數值就會開啟一個黃金時代。\n在黃金時代，文化和產能積累速率+20%，\n每個至少產出1金錢的地塊將額外提供1金錢。

Roads and Railroads = 道路與鐵路
Roads reduce the Movement Points required to move between two tiles connected by Roads. = 連成線的道路會減小經過單位的移動力損耗。
Railroads improve this reduction even more! = 鐵路相比道路效果更強！
This greatly improves the speed you can get Units around the map. = 這會極大改善你單位的機動能力。
Until you research the technology that removes it, Roads do not cross Rivers = 道路不會取消跨河移動的懲罰，除非你已研究移除此懲罰的科技
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. = 用道路或鐵路將你的首都與其他城市連接起來，會為你產出貿易路線的金錢。
However, since each Road and Railroad have a Maintenance Cost, it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow and only place where needed. = 但是道路和鐵路本身也需要你支出金錢作為維護費，優先在大城市間修路是筆劃算的買賣。

Trade Route = 貿易路線
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. You earn more Gold the more Population the City and your Capital has. = 用道路或鐵路將你的首都與其他城市連接起來，會為你產出貿易路線的金錢。這份金錢取決於你首都和另一城市的人口數量。
Note that each road costs 1 Gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 Gold, so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 註意！每格道路每回合扣除1金錢，鐵路扣除2金錢，所以優先在大城市間修路更劃算。
Railroads connecting a city to the Capital also provide a 25% Production Boost to the City, but not the Capital. = 用鐵路將首都與其他城市連接起來，會為其他城市提供25%的產能加成！
Trade Routes are also connected over Water via certain buildings like the Harbor. As long as there is a chain that can reach the Capital, there's a Trade Route. Look for this symbol in Yellow below the City Name to mean you have an active Trade Route to your Capital. = 貿易還可以通過水路進行，只要你的沿海城市修建了港口。一旦有一座與你首都陸路連接的臨海城市修建了港口，其他所有修建港口的臨海城市也會建立貿易路線。城市名字下方的黃色小三角就表示此城市已與首都建立貿易路線。
Trade Routes can get broken either by Blockades or by Removing/Pillaging the connecting Road/Railroad chain. = 貿易路線隨時會因為連接線路破損而崩潰，註意保護。
See also City Blockade = 另見城市封鎖

Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 當您建立了兩三座城市後，可能已經經過了100～150回合，\n這時您應該思考和謀劃如何贏得遊戲的勝利--如果此時你還沒有勝利的話！
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 在 Unciv 中有四種獲勝方式。它們是：\n - 文化勝利：完成 5 項社會政策樹(分支)並建立烏托邦計劃\n - 統治勝利：作為最後生存的文明\n - 科學勝利：成為第一個建造通往半人馬座α星的太空飛船\n - 外交 勝利：建立聯合國並贏得選票。
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 總而言之，這些就是 Unciv 的基礎——建立一個繁榮的城市，慢慢擴張以維持快樂值，並為自己想要追求的勝利條件做好準備。\n顯然，實際的遊戲遠遠不止於此，但重要的是，在你不會游泳之前不要跳入深水區。

Enemy City = 敵方城市
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 您已經包圍了敵人的一座城市!\n當城市的耐久降至1時就可以被佔領。\n只能使用近戰單位佔領城市。\n城市每回合會自動回復少許耐久，所以最好先使用遠端單位攻擊它，\n同時使用您的近戰單位來保護遠端單位，直到城市被佔領!

Luxury Resource = 奢侈資源
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 你的領土內的奢侈資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的奢侈資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n您擁有的每種獨一無二的奢侈資源都會給您的文明+5快樂，\n每種奢侈資源只能提供一份快樂加成，數量超過1的同種資源並不會提供更多的快樂，\n所以用它們和其他文明進行貿易吧!

Strategic Resource = 戰略資源
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 你的領土內的戰略資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的戰略資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n建造/訓練特定的項目(單位/建築)時將會消耗相應的戰略資源。如需要消耗1單位的馬來訓練1個騎手單位，\n沒有馬就不能訓練騎手。當該單位或建築被摧毀時，此資源將能再次使用。\n如果獲取資源途徑出現中斷，需要該資源的單位將受到戰鬥力減成，直至重新獲得該資源。
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 與奢侈資源不同，地圖上顯示的每個戰略資源圖示將提供多於1單位的該種資源。\n頂部資訊欄顯示了你擁有多少未使用的戰略資源。\n在概覽介面點擊“資源”按鈕可以查看你所擁有資源的完整資訊。

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 這座城市再也不能抵抗了!\n然而，要征服城市，請使用您的近戰單位佔領它。

After Conquering = 佔領城市的處理
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 當征服了一座城市，您可以選擇解放、併吞、傀儡甚至摧毀它。
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = \n解放城市會將城市歸還其原擁有者，並且大幅提升外交關係！\n\n併吞城市會使你獲得城市完整控制權，但會使居民不滿度乘2倍！\n在城市中建造法院將消除不滿度懲罰。\n\n傀儡城市意味無法控制城市生產。\n被傀儡的城市不會增加額外科技和社會政策開銷。\n一個被傀儡的城市可以隨時被併吞，但被併吞的城市無法回到傀儡狀態。\n\n摧毀城市會使每回合減少1人口，直到其被夷平！\n您無法摧毀一個文明起始城市或該宗教的聖城。

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 您遇到蠻族了！\n蠻族會不分青紅皂白地攻擊靠近它的每一個單位，\n所以請不要讓您的移民等平民單位靠近他們，同時還要注意你的斥候！

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 您遇到了另一個文明!\n其他文明一開始是和平的，您可以和他們進行貿易，\n但是他們以後可能會選擇對您宣戰。

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 當您完成了阿波羅計畫，可以開始在您的城市中建造飛船部件(需要相應科技)，\n來通過太空競賽贏得科技勝利！

Injured Units = 受傷單位
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 受傷的單位造成的傷害較少，但該回合他們若處於駐守狀態，則會恢復生命值。\n單位在敵方領土或中立土地上每回合治療 10 點生命值，\n 在你的領土內為 20 點，在你的城市內為 25 點。

Workers = 工人
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 工人對您所在城市的發展至關重要，因為只有他們才能在地塊上建造設施。\n設施可以提高地塊的產出，\n當市民在建有設施的地塊工作時，將給您的城市帶來更多的收益，同時城市也會發展得更快。

Siege Units = 攻城者單位
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 攻城單位對城市具有極強的毀滅力，但在進攻前必須先把它架設起來。\n您的攻城單位架設起來後，它就可以從當前的地塊發起攻擊，\n但是一旦它移動到其他地塊，就需要重新架設。

Embarking = 陸軍單位的船運
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 一旦研究了某種特定的技術，你的陸地單位就可以上船，讓他們穿越水域。\n進入或離開水域需要整個回合。
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 單位在船上時沒有防禦能力，只能根據你的科技時代具有固定的防禦力量，所以要看好你在水中的單位！\n遠程單位不能攻擊，近戰單位有力量削弱，並且都有有限的視野。

Idle Units = 空閑單位
Clicking 'Next unit' moves to the next idle unit in the queue (as listed in Overview -> Units). After issuing an order to an unit, if 'Auto Unit Cycle' in Options -> Gameplay is enabled, you will automatically select the next idle unit. = 點擊「下個閑置單位」按鈕會移動到隊列中的下一個閑置單位(如在「概覽」->「單位」中所列出的)。如果在「選項」->「遊戲內容」中啟用了「自動循環單位」，那麽在向一個單位下達命令後，系統將自動選擇下一個閑置單位。
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again, or command the unit to 'Skip turn'. = 如果你不想在這一回合移動某個單位，可以通過再次點擊「下個閑置單位」按鈕跳過它，或者命令該單位「跳過回合」。
If you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Options -> Gameplay -> Check for idle units. = 如果你想要完全禁用「下個閑置單位」功能，可以在「選項」->「遊戲內容」->「回合結束前查看閑置單位」中切換該選項。
If you'd rather 'Next unit' cycle the units and not mark them as Done, you can change it in the Options -> Gameplay menu. = 如果你希望「下個閑置單位」功能在循環單位時不將它們標記為「已完成」，你可以在「選項」->「遊戲內容」菜單中進行更改。
You can also cycle through the idle units using the left and right triangles on the Unit Table in the lower left of the screen. Or by default using the Cycle button next to the 'Next Unit' button. = 你還可以通過屏幕左下角的單位表中的左右三角按鈕來循環瀏覽閑置單位。或者，默認情況下，也可以使用「下個閑置單位」按鈕旁邊的「循環」按鈕來實現。

Contact Me = 聯繫我吧！
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n Unciv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 很好!當您已經熟悉了遊戲的全部內容，\n您會發現遊戲目前是不完整的，它還處於開發狀態。\n不過Unciv將永遠是開源和免費的，\n這意味著您無須擔心廣告或付費問題。
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 您的支持將激勵著我進一步完善它，\n我一定會竭盡全力、精益求精。\n感謝玩家們的支持--您們是最棒的!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 如果喜歡它，請到Play Store對它進行評價。\n如果您發現了遊戲存在的問題或有什麼好的意見和建議，\n請聯繫我！\n我的email地址：yairm210@hotmail.com，\nGitHub專案頁面：https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv。

Pillaging = 劫掠
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 軍隊可以劫掠設施，同時恢復25點血量並奪取資源。被劫掠的地塊仍可以有基本的地塊產出，但原本從設施獲得的額外產出 - 比如資源加成和戰略資源 - 將無法獲得。\n工人可以修復這些設施，修復所需時間比建造的時間少。\n劫掠某些設施可以為你帶來金錢的收入。

Experience = 經驗
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 戰鬥中單位獲得的經驗可用於該單位的晉升。\n單位在近戰攻擊時獲得的經驗大於遠端攻擊時，在進攻時獲得的經驗大於防禦時。
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 單個單位與蠻族單位戰鬥時最多可獲得30經驗值-這意味著最多2次晉升。在那之後，該單位與蠻族單位戰鬥將不會獲得任何經驗。

If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = 如果您設法通過貿易、擴張或征服獲得所需的奢侈品，城市將慶祝我們愛國王日 20 回合。
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 在我們愛國王日期間，這座城市的增長速度將加快 25%。
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = 這意味著探索和貿易對於發展您的城市很重要！

Air Combat and Interception = 空戰與空中攔截
Air Combat is very similar to normal Combat, with a few wrinkles. Damage is still dealt using the same equations based on the relative Strength of the Attacking and Defending Unit. = 空戰與一般戰鬥非常相似，卻有些許不同。傷害仍以同一個基於攻守雙方相對強度的方程式計算。
However, before the Attacker and Defender fight, there is an added combat phase called Interception. If there is any unit with Interception Range that covers the target attacked tile, then it will attempt to Intercept the Attacking Air Unit. If multiple units can Intercept, the one with higher Intercept chance does it. = 然而，在攻守雙方交戰前添加了稱作“攔截”的階段。如果任何單位的攔截範圍涵括該攻擊目標地塊，其將會試圖攔截攻擊方的空中單位。假如存在複數能進行攔截的單位，其中攔截率較高者將進行攔截。
Generally Land/Naval Units have an Intercept Range of 2 Tiles, and Air Units have an Intercept Range of their Attack Range. = 一般而言，陸地或海軍單位的攔截範圍為 2 格地塊，而空軍單位具有等同於其攻擊範圍的攔截範圍。
Ground and Naval Units don't require movement points to Intercept, just Attacks. Air Units cannot have moved nor attacked in the preceding turn. = 陸地或海軍單位無需移動點數即可進行攔截，惟攻擊時需要。空軍單位必須沒有在上個回合攻擊或移動過才行。
The Intercepting Unit rolls to see if it hits. Whether it hits or not costs an Attack, and most units (without Promotions) can only Attack Once per Nation's Turn. It does NOT cost Movement Points, but Air Units that have used their Movement cannot Intercept between turns. = 以隨機方式決定該攔截單位是否擊中。無論擊中與否皆視為消耗一次攻擊，而大部分（無晉升）單位僅可在每個國家的回合中各攻擊一次。這並不會消耗移動點數，但空軍單位在上一個回合行動過的話則無法於回合之間進行攔截。
If the Intercepting Unit Hits, it deals damage according to the Combat Strength calculation to the Attacking Air Unit, potentially with any Strength Bonuses that apply to Interception. It does not receive damage from the Attacking Air Unit. = 若該攔截單位擊中目標，則依據戰鬥強度計算其給予攻擊方空中單位的傷害，並適用所有攔截加成。它不會受到來自此攻擊方空中單位的傷害。
After Interception resolves, the Attacking Air Unit and the Defending Unit in the targeted tile do Combat as normal, with damage dealt to both sides. = 結束攔截後，攻擊方的空中單位將與位在目標地塊上的防守方單位進行一般對戰，雙方各自承受傷害。
To help deal with Interceptions, see Air Sweeps. = 想知道如何處理空中攔截，請參閱“空中掃蕩”。

Air Sweeps = 空中掃蕩
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = 戰鬥機單位能夠在一個地塊上執行空中掃蕩，協助清理可以威脅到此地塊的敵對空中、海上或陸上單位的潛在攔截。
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = 當這個攻擊動作發動時，將會引誘攔截者們以保護您的空中單位，特別是轟炸機。
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = 如果有單位能抵達此地塊，您的單位將總是引誘出攔截者，即使攔截單位可能攔截失敗。
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = 如果攔截單位不是空中單位(例如地面或海上)，則雙方都不會受到傷害。
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = 如果攔截單位是空中單位，則雙方會在沒有攔截加乘的戰鬥中受到傷害。只有發起空中掃蕩的單位獲得空中掃蕩加乘。

Fortify, Guard, Withdraw = 駐守，警戒，撤退
Most Land units have the ability to Fortify. As they spend time without moving, they will slowly gain a Fortification Bonus to their Combat Strength representing digging in and preparing in case of an attack. = 大多數陸地單位都有駐守的能力。當他們不移動時，他們會逐漸獲得戰鬥力駐守加成，這代表了他們在準備防禦攻擊時挖掘和準備。
Some units have the ability to Withdraw before a melee attack is struck. However, perhaps you wish for them to stand their ground to protect a particular tile. If you do, then give them the Guard command and they will stay fixed until they die or you give them fresh orders. = 一些單位在近戰攻擊發生前有能力撤退。然而，也許你希望他們堅守陣地以保護特定的地塊。如果你這樣做，就給他們下達警戒命令，他們會一直堅守直到死亡或你給他們新的命令。
This is NOT the same as Fortify but they will still gain the Fortification Bonus. They will simply not utilize their Withdraw ability. Fortified units with the Withdraw ability will try to flee when attacked. = 這與駐守不同，但他們仍然會獲得駐守加成。他們只是不會使用他們的撤退能力。具有撤退能力的駐守單位在受到攻擊時會嘗試逃跑。

City Tile Blockade = 城市地塊封鎖
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = 你的某些地塊被敵人封鎖了：當敵軍站在你擁有的地塊時，該地塊將沒有任何產出，並且本回合不能被城市利用。城市將自動從被封鎖的地塊上重新分配人口。
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = 敵方的陸地軍事單位將封鎖他們所處在的地塊。敵方的海軍部隊還會封鎖相鄰的水域。為了保護你的地塊不被封鎖，可以在地塊上放置一友好的軍事單位，或擊退入侵者。

City Blockade = 城市封鎖
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = 你的某些城市被水路封鎖了！——當沿海城市的所有相鄰水域被封鎖時，該城市將失去與所有其他城市的港口聯繫，包括首都。請確保通過部署友軍海軍部隊擊退入侵者來解除對城市的封鎖。

Spies! = 隔牆有耳！
The first time a civ reaches the Renaissance era each nation gets one spy. Every time a civ reaches an era afterwards they get one more spy. = 首次有文明發展至文藝復興時代時，各國獲得一名間諜。此後每當有文明進入更晚期的時代，各國再獲得一名間諜。
Spies can be sent out to foreign cities to steal technology, rigging elections or stage coups. Place them in your own cities to do counter-intelligence work. = 間諜可被派遣至外國城市以竊取科技、操縱選舉或策動政變。將他們置於己方城市以進行反情報工作。
Only one spy per civ is allowed in each city. Spies that are not in any city are on vacation in your spy hideout. = 在同個城市中，每個文明僅可派遣一名間諜。不在城市中的間諜則在我方間諜的藏匿處休假。
Spies set up in cities of major civilizations will try to steal technology at a rate which is based off of the science production in the city. Succeeding to steal technology will level up your spy. Failing to succeed will level up the defending spy if it is present. = 在主要文明的城市中的間諜會試圖竊取科技，成功率以該城市的科研產量為基礎進行計算。若成功竊取科技則會使我方間諜升級。若失敗則會使防禦方的間諜升級（前提是該防禦方有派駐間諜）。
Spies set in city-states will try to rig the elections in order to gain influence and reduce the influence of other civilizations. Only one spy partaking in rigging the election can win. = 在城邦的間諜會試圖操縱選舉以增強影響力並削弱其他文明的影響力。參與某次選舉的間諜之中僅會有一名獲勝者。
A spy that is rigging an election in a city-state may also stage a coup. The likelihood of success for the coup depends on your relative influence to the current ally of the city-state, your spy level, and the level of the spy that the current ally has in the city-state if present. Succeeding a coup will make you their new ally and reduce the influence of all other civs. Failing a coup will kill your spy and level up the defending spy if present. = 在城邦操縱選舉的間諜也可以策動政變。政變的成功率取決於我方與該城邦當前盟友的相對影響力及我方間諜等級，若該當前盟友在當地派駐間諜，則亦計算其等級。
Spies that are set up in your own cities will be conducting counter-intelligence. They reduce the success chance of other spies trying to steal your technology. = 在我方城市中的間諜會進行反情報工作。這樣會使其他間諜竊取我方科技的成功率降低。
Spies at a higher rank have a higher chance of success. The max rank a spy can reach is rank 3. After a spy is killed it will revive after a certain amount of turns back at rank 1. = 愈高階的間諜成功率愈高。間諜的最高階級為 3 。遭到殺害的間諜會在經過特定回合後恢復，並回到階級 1。
Building buildings like the constabulary and police station will reduce the technology steal rate of spies in that city. = 諸如民警或警察局等的建築會降低間諜在該城市竊取科技的成功率。
Espionage is available using the Gods and Kings ruleset. To enable it in a new game click advanced settings, then click on the Enable Espionage option. = 間諜在國王與眾神規則集下可用。想在新遊戲中啟用的話要先點擊進階設置，然後點擊“啟用間諜”。

The data shown is not dependent on your current game's situation, e.g. bonuses for the nation you are playing or difficulty modifiers will not affect the numbers. = 這裡的數據並不等同於您遊戲狀態的數據，例如國家加成或難度修正並不會改變文明百科中的數據。
However, it will reflect the mods you are playing! The combination of base ruleset and extension mods you select define the rules of a game, what objects exist and how they interact, and the Civilopedia mirrors these rules. = 然而，它將反映您正在玩的模組！基本規則集和您選擇的擴展模組的組合定義了遊戲規則、存在什麼物件以及它們如何相互作用，而文明百科反映了這些規則。
If you opened the Civilopedia from the main menu, the "Ruleset" will be that of the last game you started. = 如果您從主頁打開文明百科，那麼所適用的規則集將是您在之前遊戲中選擇的。

Differences from Civilization V = 與文明V的不同之處
Production Focus\nIn Civilization V, the Food yield in a city is calculated first, then population grows by consuming stored food (growth), then production is calculated, and so on one by one the other stats are calculated. Thus, citizens can produce yields in the same turn as they are born. The city focus is set to Production to assign the newborn citizen to a hill so they'll contribute Production, and then manually reassigned to a growth tile on the next turn. Alternatively, you can set city focus to Gold (e.g. with Cerro de Potosi), Faith (e.g. with Mount Sinai) or whatever gains the most yields. In Unciv, citizens only start producing yields on the next turn, so you can ignore this whole concept. = 工作重心\n在文明V中，城市的食物產量首先被計算，然後通過消耗存儲的食物來增長人口(增長)，然後計算生產，以此類推，依次計算其他統計數據。因此，市民可以在出生的同時生產產出。將城市焦點設置為生產，以將新生市民分配到丘陵上，這樣他們將為生產做出貢獻，然後在下一輪手動重新分配到增長地塊。或者，你可以將城市工作重心設置為金錢(如富饒山)，信仰(如西奈山)或任何帶來最大產出的地方。在Unciv中，市民只會在下一回合開始生產產出，所以你可以忽略這個概念。
Science Queueing\nIn Civilization V, Science yield is calculated after production, so if you finish an item and have Science (or Gold) queued as a perpetual construction, the Production overflow from item will be converted into Science (or Gold), but the Production is not consumed, as this will only happen again on the next turn. By immediately swapping out your perpetual construction for an item on the next turn, you'll get this Science (or Gold) for free. This doesn't apply to Unciv, so don't bother. = 研究隊列\n在文明V中，科研產出在產能產出之後計算，因此如果你完成一個科技並且已經將科研(或金錢)排隊為永久建設，那麽項目的生產溢出將轉換為科研(或金錢)，但產能不會消耗，因為只會在下一回合再發生。通過立即在下一回合將你的永久建設換成項目，你將免費獲得科學科研(或金錢)。這不適用於Unciv，所以不必擔心。
Double Aqueducts\nIn Civilization V, the game sells existing copies of the building for you before providing a free copy of the building. So, if you build an aqueduct in a city, and then in the turn of adopting Tradition Complete you sell a cheap building (e.g a shrine) beforehand, the game is unable to sell more than 1 building per turn, and thus you'll keep your aqueduct, together with the new free aqueduct. Not applicable to Unciv. = 雙引水渠\n在文明V中，遊戲會在為你提供一個建築物的免費復製之前出售現有的建築物。因此，如果在一個城市中建造了一個水渠，並在采納傳統政策的回合之前賣掉了一個廉價建築物(例如一個神社)，遊戲無法在每回合出售多個建築物，因此你將保留你的引水渠，並獲得新的免費引水渠。不適用於Unciv。
Legalism Oxford\nIn Civilization V, national wonders such as Oxford University are considered culture buildings, so you can get them for free with Legalism. Not applicable to Unciv. = 律法統治的牛津大學\n在文明V中，像牛津大學這樣的國家奇跡被視為文化建築，因此你可以通過推行律法統治免費獲得它們。不適用於Unciv。
Roads and Forts\nIn Civilization V, you can't use roads and forts in enemy territory. In Unciv, you can use them, so instead of mindlessly constructing them everywhere when at war, you need to decide if and when they'll benefit you more than your opponents. = 道路和堡壘\n在文明V中，你不能在敵方領土中使用路和堡壘。在Unciv中，你可以使用它們，所以在戰爭時無腦地在每個地方建造是沒有意義的，你需要決定什麽時候以及如何使用道路和堡壘比你的對手更有利。
Citizen Conversion\nIn Civilization V, a citizen is born religious if the parent city is already converted. This is not the case in Unciv, which can lead to temporary deconversion of a city when it grows. = 市民宗教轉換\n在文明V中，如果父城市已經被轉化，一個市民出生時會成為宗教市民。在Unciv中並非如此，這可能導致城市在增長時出現暫時的反轉。
Unassigned Citizens\nIn Civilization V, unassigned citizens are considered specialists, and subject to the same type of bonuses (e.g. Korea's ability). It can be worthwhile to leave citizens unassigned, instead of being assigned to a tile. Not applicable to Unciv. = 未分配市民\n在文明V中，未分配市民被視為專家，並受到相同類型的獎勵(例如朝鮮的特殊能力)影響；有時將市民保持未分配可能比分配到地塊上更值得。不適用於Unciv。
Settler Construction\nIn Civilization V, cities can't starve when constructing settlers, so you can assign all citizens to production tiles and none to food tiles. In Unciv, citizens keep consuming two food per turn. = 組建移民\n在文明V中，建造殖民者時城市不會挨餓，因此你可以將所有市民分配到生產地塊，而不是分配到食物地塊。在Unciv中，市民每回合仍會消耗兩個食物。
Water Melee Attack\nAs result of a Discord poll, Water Melee units can attack military land units on the shore, unlike in Civilization V. = 水陸突襲\n根據Discord上的投票結果，水陸突襲單位可以襲擊岸上的軍事陸地單位，這與文明V不同。
Tile improvements\nIn Civilzation V, workers start working on an improvement-under-construction at the beginning of movement. Unciv changes this, to allow players to assign workers to tiles, and then reconsider and change improvement or move them elsewhere. = 地塊改良\n在文明V中，工人在移動時開始建造一個正在建設的改良。Unciv不同，可以讓玩家將工人分配到地塊上，然後重新考慮並更改改良或將它們移動工人。
Forest and Jungle Visibility\nIn Unciv, forests and jungles are visible 1 tile outside visibility range. In Civilization V, this is the behaviour of hills and mountains, but not of forests and jungles, yet jungle and forest can block hills, and hill + forest can block mountain, indicating they're on the same elevation. This is considered to be a bug in the otherwise well-structured visibility logic in Civilization V. = 森林和叢林的視野\n在Unciv中，森林和叢林的視野比視野範圍大1個地塊。在文明V中，這是山丘和山脈的行為，但不適用於森林和叢林，然而叢林和森林可以阻塞山丘，山丘+森林可以阻塞山脈，表明它們處於同一高度。在文明V中，與其他邏輯相比，這被認為是一個錯誤。
 # Requires translation!
City razing\nIn Civilization V, the player can never raze any of the cities he/she founded. Not applicable to Unciv. = 

Founding Cities\nThe Settler is a unit that can found a new city. You can build a Settler unit in a city with at least 2 population, and then move them to a good location to found a new city. This will usually be your main way of acquiring more cities. = 建城\n移民是一個可以建立新城市的單位：你可以在至少有2個人口的城市中建造移民，然後將它們移動到一個好地塊來建立一個新城市。這通常是你獲取更多城市的主要途徑。
Food conversion to Production\nDuring the construction of a Settler, the city will not grow. Instead, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and from there on every 4th, excess Food (Growth) is converted into Production, with the rest of the excess Food being lost. = 食物轉化為生產\n在建造移民時，城市人口不會增長。相反，第1、第2、第4，以及從那時起每4，多余的食物(增長)會轉化為產能，其余多余的食物將會丟失。
