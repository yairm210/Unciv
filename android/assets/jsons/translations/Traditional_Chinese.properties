# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that

# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

 # Requires translation!

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

The blessings of heaven be upon you, beloved king Darius of Persia! You lead a strong and wise people. In the morning of the world, the great Persian leader Cyrus revolted against the mighty Median empire and by 550 BC, the Medes were no more. Through cunning diplomacy and military prowess, great Cyrus conquered wealthy Lydia and powerful Babylon, his son conquering proud Egypt some years later. Over time, Persian might expanded into far away Macedonia, at the very door of the upstart Greek city-states. Long would Persia prosper until the upstart villain Alexander of Macedon, destroyed the great empire in one shocking campaign. =

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10,000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, however, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks who fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and through a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological superiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! = 
 # Requires translation!

Your men stand proudly to greet you, Great Attila, grand warrior and ruler of the Hunnic empire. Together with your brother Bleda you expanded the boundaries of your empire, becoming the most powerful and frightening force of the 5th century. You bowed the Eastern Roman Emperors to your will and took kingdom after kingdom along the Danube and Nisava Rivers. As the sovereign ruler of the Huns, you marched your army across Europe into Gaul, planning to extend your already impressive lands all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Your untimely death led to the quick disintegration and downfall of your empire, but your name and deeds have created an everlasting legacy for your people. =

Fearsome General, your people call for the recreation of a new Hunnic Empire, one which will make the exploits and histories of the former seem like the faded dreaming of a dying sun.

Introduction = 遊戲介紹
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 您好，歡迎來到絢麗多彩的UnCiv遊戲世界！\n文明遊戲是複雜的，讓我們通過一些簡單的任務來熟悉它吧。\n這些任務是可選的，當然您也可以自己探索遊戲世界！

New Game = 開始新遊戲
Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = 您的第一個任務是建立首都，\n這個任務是非常重要的，因為通常情況下首都會成為你的文明最繁榮的城市。\n遊戲中解鎖政策、科技等帶來的很多增益往往只對首都有效，所以首都的發展代表了您的文明的發達程度。
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to watch out for! = 如何選擇一個合適的首都建立位置？這不是一個容易回答的問題。\n通常情況下，選擇緊鄰奢侈資源的位置是選擇建立點的不二法則。\n奢侈資源主要包括寶石、棉花、絲綢等(這些資源在地圖上用一個“笑臉”標示)，\n開發這些資源可以增加您的文明的快樂。當然，你也應該留意那些訓練單位時所需要的戰略資源，比如鐵。
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = 但是，城市的邊界不是固定的，它會隨著文化的積累慢慢擴張。\n這意味著你並不一定要把城市建在太過靠近資源的位置。\n舉例來說，比如, 你需要獲得戰略資源鐵--但悲劇的是該資源緊鄰沙漠。\n您無需把城市建立在緊鄰沙漠的位置。相反的，可以選擇離該資源稍遠而且更加富饒的地塊。\n隨著城市的不斷繁榮發展和邊界的擴張，城市將慢慢靠近該資源直至獲得它。\n如果需要馬上獲得所需的戰略資源你可以選擇建城在靠近資源的位置--\n有時候這樣做可能對遊戲的勝利更有利，但通常情況下您都有充裕的時間選擇更加合理的建立點。
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = 您的城市第一個訓練的單位應當是勇士或斥候。\n我非常喜歡勇士，因為他可以用於防守，\n同時在研發“鐵器”科技後只需花少量的金錢就可以把他升級為劍士。\n當您的城市位於大片森林或丘陵間時斥候是非常有效的選擇，\n因為他在這些地形移動時沒有移動力懲罰。\n如果您是4x遊戲的行家裡手，緊隨第一個勇士或斥候的單位應該是移民。\n請記住：快速擴張永遠是獲取勝利的不二法門！

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 在遊戲開始的最初幾回合，\n您只需進行很少的操作。\n但隨著您的文明的發展，\n很多事情必須面面俱到。

Culture and Policies = 文化與政策
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 文化可以通過建設文化建築或奇觀、推行社會政策等積累。\n當您有足夠的文化時, 可以推行一項社會政策，\n每項社會政策都給您一定的獎勵。
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 社會政策被劃分成幾個分支，每個分支都有自己的子政策，\n當一個分支社會政策的所有子政策都被推行，\n會有一個額外的獎勵。
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 隨著每項社會政策的推行，每座城市的建立，\n推行新的社會政策時的文化花費會隨之提升--所以要明智地選擇!

City Expansion = 城市擴張
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 當一個城市積累了足夠的文化時，城市的邊界就會擴張一個臨近地塊。\n您無法控制它將擴張到哪個地塊，但系統會優先考慮擁有資源和更高產出收益的地塊。
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 每擴張一個地塊都需要更多的文化，但一般來說，你的第一個城市最終會擴張到擁有一個廣闊的領土範圍。
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 雖然你的城市將會永遠擴張下去，但你的市民只能在距離城市中心3格內的地塊上工作。\n在建立新城市時應考慮到這一點。

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 隨著城市規模擴大，城市的可工作地塊也會變得越來越多。\n這時，你將不得不面對遊戲中關於“快樂”的機制。在遊戲中，快樂的產出是所有城市總和計算，\n快樂的消耗則由城市數量和人口數量決定。\n隨著城市數量的增加和城市人口的增長您將會很快發現：保持你的文明始終處於快樂是一件越來越難的事。
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 此外，在未研發相關科技前您將無法建造任何能增加快樂的建築、奇觀和開發可以增加快樂的奢侈資源。\n如果您的文明處於不滿，將會極大地減慢城市發展速度。\n如果文明的不滿狀態非常嚴重(頂部資訊欄用一個“哭臉”標示)，\n您的部隊戰鬥力將會有極大的減成。
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 這意味著在 Unciv中快速擴張是非常困難的。\n雖然這並非不可能，但作為一個新玩家，你可能不應該這樣做。\n那你應該怎麼做？放鬆、偵察和通過建築工人來改善你所擁有的土地。\n只有在找到你認為合適的地點後才建造新城市。

Unhappiness = 不滿
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 看來你的公民們很不開心！\n在不開心的同時，你們的文明會遭受許多不利影響，隨著不開心的程度越來越高，嚴重程度也會越來越高。
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 產生不滿的原因有兩個:人口數和城市數，\n每座城市產生3點不滿，每個市民產生1點不滿。
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 有 2 種主要方法可以對抗不快樂：\n 為您的人民建造增加快樂值的建築\n或增加您境內的奢侈品資源。

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 您的文明進入了一個黃金時代!\n您的快樂每個回合都會積累，\n當快樂積累到一定數值就會開啟一個黃金時代。\n在黃金時代，文化和產能積累速率+20%，\n每個至少產出1金錢的地塊將額外提供1金錢。

Roads and Railroads = 道路與鐵路
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 您已經建立了第二座城市!\n通過道路連接您的城市和首都來建立貿易路線，\n貿易路線將提供額外的金錢產出。\n請注意，道路經過的每個地塊都需要1金錢的維護費，\n所以等待城市的自然發展可能更經濟!

Victory Types = 獲取勝利的方法
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 當您建立了兩三座城市後，可能已經經過了100～150回合，\n這時您應該思考和謀劃如何贏得遊戲的勝利--如果此時你還沒有勝利的話！
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 在 Unciv 中有四種獲勝方式。它們是：\n - 文化勝利：完成 5 項社會政策樹(分支)並建立烏托邦計劃\n - 統治勝利：作為最後生存的文明\n - 科學勝利：成為第一個建造通往半人馬座α星的太空飛船\n - 外交 勝利：建立聯合國並贏得選票。
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 總而言之，這些就是 Unciv 的基礎——建立一個繁榮的城市，慢慢擴張以維持快樂值，並為自己想要追求的勝利條件做好準備。\n顯然，實際的遊戲遠遠不止於此，但重要的是，在你不會游泳之前不要跳入深水區。

Enemy City = 敵方城市
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 您已經包圍了敵人的一座城市!\n當城市的耐久降至1時就可以被佔領。\n只能使用近戰單位佔領城市。\n城市每回合會自動回復少許耐久，所以最好先使用遠端單位攻擊它，\n同時使用您的近戰單位來保護遠端單位，直到城市被佔領!

Luxury Resource = 奢侈資源
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 你的領土內的奢侈資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的奢侈資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n您擁有的每種獨一無二的奢侈資源都會給您的文明+5快樂，\n每種奢侈資源只能提供一份快樂加成，數量超過1的同種資源並不會提供更多的快樂，\n所以用它們和其他文明進行貿易吧!

Strategic Resource = 戰略資源
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 你的領土內的戰略資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的戰略資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n建造/訓練特定的項目(單位/建築)時將會消耗相應的戰略資源。如需要消耗1單位的馬來訓練1個騎手單位，\n沒有馬就不能訓練騎手。當該單位或建築被摧毀時，此資源將能再次使用。\n如果獲取資源途徑出現中斷，需要該資源的單位將受到戰鬥力減成，直至重新獲得該資源。
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 與奢侈資源不同，地圖上顯示的每個戰略資源圖示將提供多於1單位的該種資源。\n頂部資訊欄顯示了你擁有多少未使用的戰略資源。\n在概覽介面點擊“資源”按鈕可以查看你所擁有資源的完整資訊。

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 這座城市再也不能抵抗了!\n然而，要征服城市，請使用您的近戰單位佔領它。

After Conquering = 佔領城市的處理
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 當征服了一座城市，您可以選擇摧毀、傀儡甚至吞併它。\n“摧毀城市”可以令城市人口每回合-1，人口為0時城市將完全被摧毀。 (Translation update needed!)
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost, but its citizens will generate 1.5x the regular unhappiness.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = “傀儡城市”意味著您將無法控制該城市的產能，\n好處是該城市將不會額外增加您研發科技和推行社會政策時的花費，同時該城市人口產生的不滿是正常值的1.5倍。\n“吞併城市”將會給予您該城市的絕對控制權，但該城市人口產生的不滿將是正常值的2倍。\n在城市內建造“法庭”可以使人口產生的不滿降低到正常值。\n可以在任何時候吞併已傀儡的城市，但已吞併的城市無法再變為傀儡狀態。選擇前請考慮清楚！ (Translation update needed!)

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 您遇到蠻族了！\n蠻族會不分青紅皂白地攻擊靠近它的每一個單位，\n所以請不要讓您的移民等平民單位靠近他們，同時還要注意你的斥候！

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 您遇到了另一個文明!\n其他文明一開始是和平的，您可以和他們進行貿易，\n但是他們以後可能會選擇對您宣戰。

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 當您完成了阿波羅計畫，可以開始在您的城市中建造飛船部件(需要相應科技)，\n來通過太空競賽贏得科技勝利！

Injured Units = 受傷單位
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 受傷的單位造成的傷害較少，但他們在處於駐守狀態的回合後會恢復。\n單位在敵方領土或中立土地上每回合治療 10 點生命值，\n 在你的領土內為 20 個，在你的城市內為 25 個。

Workers = 工人
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 工人對您所在城市的發展至關重要，因為只有他們才能在地塊上建造設施。\n設施可以提高地塊的產出，\n當市民在建有設施的地塊工作時，將給您的城市帶來更多的收益，同時城市也會發展得更快。

Siege Units = 攻城者單位
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 攻城單位對城市具有極強的毀滅力，但在進攻前必須先把它架設起來。\n您的攻城單位架設起來後，它就可以從當前的地塊發起攻擊，\n但是一旦它移動到其他地塊，就需要重新架設。

Embarking = 陸軍單位的船運
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 一旦研究了某種特定的技術，你的陸地單位就可以上船，讓他們穿越水域。\n進入或離開水域需要整個回合。
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 單位在船上時沒有防禦能力，只能根據你的科技時代具有固定的防禦力量，所以要看好你在水中的單位！\n遠程單位不能攻擊，近戰單位有力量削弱，並且都有有限的視野。

Idle Units = 空閒單位
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units. = 如果當前回合不想對某個單位執行任何操作，可以點擊右上方“下個閒置單位”按鈕來跳過該單位。\n如果一段時間內不想對其執行任何操作，可以對該單位執行“駐守”或“休眠”指令，\n系統執行“回合結束前查看閒置單位”指令時將自動跳過處於“駐守”或“休眠”狀態的單位。\n如果想完全禁用“下個閒置單位”按鈕，請進入“設置”功能表並將“回合結束前查看閒置單位”設置為“否”。

Contact Me = 聯繫我吧！
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n UnCiv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 很好!當您已經熟悉了遊戲的全部內容，\n您會發現遊戲目前是不完整的，它還處於開發狀態。\n不過UnCiv將永遠是開源和免費的，\n這意味著您無須擔心廣告或付費問題。

Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 如果喜歡它，請到Play Store對它進行評價。\n如果您發現了遊戲存在的問題或有什麼好的意見和建議，\n請聯繫我！\n我的email地址：yairm210@hotmail.com，\nGitHub專案頁面：https://github.com/yairm210/UnCiv。

Pillaging = 劫掠
 # Requires translation!
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 

Experience = 經驗
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 戰鬥中單位獲得的經驗可用於該單位的晉升。\n單位在近戰攻擊時獲得的經驗大於遠端攻擊時，在進攻時獲得的經驗大於防禦時。
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 單個單位與蠻族單位戰鬥時最多可獲得30經驗值-這意味著最多2次晉升。在那之後，該單位與蠻族單位戰鬥將不會獲得任何經驗。

Combat = 戰鬥
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 單位和城市都會因戰鬥而損傷，戰鬥受到許多不同因素的影響。\n每個單位都有一個特定的“基礎”戰鬥值用於戰鬥結算，該數值受遊戲難度設置、單位擁有的晉升技能、所處的位置等因素影響。
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 當近戰攻擊和防禦時，單位使用“戰鬥力”作為“基礎”戰鬥值。\n當進行遠端攻擊時，單位使用“遠端戰鬥力”作為“基礎”戰鬥值。
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 遠端攻擊可以在遠距離進行，這取決於單位的“攻擊範圍”。\n近戰攻擊時防禦者會對攻擊者造成反擊傷害，遠程攻擊則不會。

Research Agreements = 科研協定
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 在科研協定中，你和另一個文明將共同研究科技。\n在協定結束時，你和另一個文明都將“一次性”獲得大量的科研點數，這將用於你尚未研究的科技。
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 科研協定的收益取決於協定期間科研產出總量較小的那個文明——因此，選擇簽訂科研協定物件時請慎重！

Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, don't conquer other cities and can't be traded with. = 並不是所有文明都在和你爭奪勝利。城邦是無法勝利的文明，他們不能征服其他城市，也不能進行貿易。
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 相反，與城邦的外交關係取決於影響力——一個表示“城邦有多喜歡你”的數值。\n與他們的敵人戰鬥，解放他們的城市，或者給予他們一大筆金錢，都可以增加你對他們的影響力。
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 當影響力超過30時，根據城邦類型的不同您會獲得相應的獎勵。\n當影響力超過60，並且在所有文明中您對他們的影響力最高時，您將被他們視為“盟友”，可獲得更多的獎勵效果，同時還可以使用他們領土上的奢侈資源和戰略資源。

Great People = 偉人
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = 特定的建築和城市中的專業人員，每回合會產生偉人點數。\n不同類型的偉人，他們的點數積累分別獨立計算。\n每回合可獲得的偉人點數和已積累的偉人點數可以在概覽介面查看。
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 一旦積累了足夠的點數，一位該類型的偉人將誕生！\n每位偉人都可以建造偉大的設施，隨著時間的推移產生大量收益，或者立即消耗以提供一定的獎勵。
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 偉人設施同時還有開發其所在地塊戰略資源的功能，所以請不必擔心偉人設施所在地塊的戰略資源開發問題！

Removing Terrain Features = 清除地貌
 # Requires translation!
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = 

Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 富士山、直布羅陀巨岩和大堡礁等自然奇觀，都是獨特的、無法通行的地貌，是大自然母親的傑作，具有不同於一般地形的非凡品質。\n開發它們會為你帶來大量的文化、科研、金錢或產能收益，這就是為什麼需要儘快將其納入你的帝國的原因。

Keyboard = 鍵盤
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = 如果您有鍵盤，則可以使用一些快捷鍵。例如，單位命令或設施選擇器鍵直接顯示在其相應的按鈕中。
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: = 在世界地圖介面上的快捷鍵如下：
 # Requires translation!
Space or 'N' - Next unit or turn\n'E' - Empire overview (last viewed page)\n'+', '-' - Zoom in / out\nHome - center on capital or open its city screen if already centered =

 # Requires translation!
Ctrl-R - Toggle tile resource display\nCtrl-Y - Toggle tile yield display\nCtrl-O - Game options\nCtrl-S - Save game\nCtrl-L - Load game = 

World Screen = 世界地圖介面
This is where you spend most of your time playing Unciv. See the world, control your units, access other screens from here. = 您玩 Unciv 的絕大部分操作都在此介面。看世界地圖，控制你的單位，或是跳轉到其他介面。

 # Requires translation!
⑲: Notifications - what happened during the last 'next turn' phase. Some are clickable to show a relevant place on the map, some even show several when you click repeatedly. =

ⓩ: And this is the red targeting circle that led to the attack pane back under ⑬. = 
 # Requires translation!
What you don't see: The phone/tablet's back button will pop the question whether you wish to leave Unciv and go back to Real Life. On desktop versions, you can use the ESC key. = 

 # Requires translation!
After building a shrine, your civilization will start generating ☮Faith. = 
 # Requires translation!
When enough ☮Faith has been generated, you will be able to found a pantheon. = 
 # Requires translation!
A pantheon will provide a small bonus for your civilization that will apply to all your cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = 
 # Requires translation!
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = 
 # Requires translation!
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = 
 # Requires translation!
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = 

 # Requires translation!
Beliefs = 
 # Requires translation!
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = 
 # Requires translation!
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = 

Religion inside cities = 城市中的宗教
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = 當建立一座城市時，它不會立即信奉一種宗教。
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = 一個城市所信奉的宗教取決於每個宗教在城市內的總壓力。
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the city screen. = 追隨者按照與這些壓力相同的比例分配，可以在城市介面查看這些追隨者。
 # Requires translation!
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = 
 # Requires translation!
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = 
 # Requires translation!
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = 
 # Requires translation!
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = 

Spreading Religion = 傳播宗教
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = 宗教的傳播是自然發生的，但可以通過傳教士或大先知來加速。
 # Requires translation!
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 
 # Requires translation!
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = 
 # Requires translation!
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = 
 # Requires translation!
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 
 # Requires translation!
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 
 # Requires translation!
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = 
 # Requires translation!
This pressure can also be seen in the city screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 
 # Requires translation!
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 
 # Requires translation!
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 
 # Requires translation!
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 

Inquisitors = 審判官
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = 審判官是最後一個宗教單位，他們的力量正在清除其他宗教。
 # Requires translation!
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = 
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is uneffected. = 

 # Requires translation!
The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 
 # Requires translation!
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 
 # Requires translation!
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = 

Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 你的城市會周期性地需要不同的奢侈品來滿足他們對生活中新事物的渴望。
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = 如果您設法通過貿易、擴張或征服獲得所需的奢侈品，城市將慶祝我們愛國王日 20 回合。
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 在我們愛國王日期間，這座城市的增長速度將加快 25%。
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = 這意味著探索和貿易對於發展您的城市很重要！
