# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that
# may not turn into valid sentences. Therefore we have the following two translations to determine
# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

ConditionalsPlacement = before

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

Blessings of the Great God be upon you, O great caliph Harun al-Rashid, leader of the mighty Arabian people! The Muslim Empire, the Caliphate, born from chaos after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, intended to apply the rule of God to all Earth. And by the will of God, the caliphate reached its full power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia, to even surpass the Great Roman Empire. The arts and sciences were a holy gift of Arabia during the Middle Ages, as the infidel lands of Europe delved deep into ignorance and chaos. Lasting for six hundred years, the Caliphate finally fell before the Mongols, the plague of the civilized world. =

Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you! India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land. Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty. For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders. In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place. In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority. After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history! =

O Great King Ramkhamhaeng, the Siamese people obey you with respect and fear! The beautiful and mysterious land of Siam is an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia, which was besieged by many foes, plagued by bloody war and great poverty, but eventually the smart and loyal Siamese people have endured and triumphed. Siam was a part of the Khmer Empire until the 13th century AD, before its brave people took arms and led a revolution to form the small Sukhothai kingdom. After many battles and diplomacy prowess, this tiny kingdom became a mighty empire, which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century. =

Greetings to the wise and brave Prince William of Orange, who freed the Netherlands and gave strength to the Dutch people.

Your actions were all aimed to create one of Europe's first modern republics, the Seven United Provinces. The rebellion was the meaning of your very life and death, as it was also the cause of your assassination in 1584. But your death has given even more pride and courage to your people, to fight for liberty against any oppressors. Carved in history as the 'Father of the Fatherland', your name is a symbol of Dutch independence for eternity. =

Because this is a complex game, there are some tutorials to help familiarize you with it. These can be disbaled in the Options -> Display menu, but please hang on if you're new here! = 
 # Requires translation!
Your first mission is to found your capital city. This is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous. Many game bonuses apply only to your capital city, and it will be the center of your empire. = 
 # Requires translation!
How do you know a city location is appropriate? Luckily, the game has already chosen a good location for you. You can settle in this place, or maybe move a turn to found on a Hill (for Production and defence) or next to a Mountain (to gain access to the Observatory building later on). = 
 # Requires translation!
You'll likely want more cities later on. For these cities, you must go and find a good place. Looking for and founding on or near Luxury resources is a good rule of thumb. = 
 # Requires translation!
Luxury resources are tiles that have things like Gems, Cotton, or Silk (indicated by a yellow background of the resource icon). These resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as Iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to keep in mind! =

Cities will house Citizens, which can work tiles up to 3 tiles away from the city. This means you don’t have to settle cities right on or next to good tiles. Let’s say, for example, that you want access to some Iron – but the resource is in a desert area. You don’t have to settle your city in the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands. Your city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource. You only need to settle right on top of resources if you need them immediately. = 
 # Requires translation!
The first thing coming out of your city depends on the strategy you want to follow, but the 'classic' build order is to build first two Scouts, then a Shrine, and three Settlers, and adopt Tradition, to explore the map quickly (Scouts ignore terrain cost), and to get an early Pantheon (if you're playing with religion enabled). = 
 # Requires translation!
But feel free to experiment with your own build orders! = 

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 在遊戲開始的最初幾回合，\n您只需進行很少的操作。\n但隨著您的文明的發展，\n很多事情必須面面俱到。

Culture and Policies = 文化與政策
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 文化可以通過建設文化建築或奇觀、推行社會政策等積累。\n當您有足夠的文化時, 可以推行一項社會政策，\n每項社會政策都給您一定的獎勵。
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 社會政策被劃分成幾個分支，每個分支都有自己的子政策，\n當一個分支社會政策的所有子政策都被推行，\n會有一個額外的獎勵。
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 隨著每項社會政策的推行，每座城市的建立，\n推行新的社會政策時的文化花費會隨之提升--所以要明智地選擇!

City Expansion = 城市擴張
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 當一個城市積累了足夠的文化時，城市的邊界就會擴張一個臨近地塊。\n您無法控制它將擴張到哪個地塊，但系統會優先考慮擁有資源和更高產出收益的地塊。
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 每擴張一個地塊都需要更多的文化，但一般來說，你的第一個城市最終會擴張到擁有一個廣闊的領土範圍。
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 雖然你的城市將會永遠擴張下去，但你的市民只能在距離城市中心3格內的地塊上工作。\n在建立新城市時應考慮到這一點。

 # Requires translation!
Food is the resource fundamental to your Cities', and as a result Nation's, population and health. = 
 # Requires translation!
Every Citizen in each City consumes Food per turn. Any left over is considered Growth and is stored in the City Center. Once enough accumulates, the City Grows and a new Citizen is added. = 
 # Requires translation!
Initially your main source of Food is the City Center itself and working a surrounding tile with a Citizen. You can increase how much is generated by gaining more Citizens to work more tiles, improving the tiles so that they yield more Food, and eventually Buildings and Policies. = 
 # Requires translation!
Since a city's number of Citizens, or Population, determines how many tiles a City can work, Food is often the most important Resource. = 

 # Requires translation!
Production is the resource that lets a City Center build new things. = 
 # Requires translation!
This can be new Buildings that are added to the City Center, or new Units that can go out across the World Map to advance your Nation's goals. = 
 # Requires translation!
Everything you can build has a Production Cost. Every turn each City generates a certain amount of Production and puts it towards whatever is at the top of the Build Queue. Once the total cost is collected, the Building or Unit is built! = 
 # Requires translation!
Any excess Production after something is built is overflowed to the next thing the City builds. Up to it's total Production Cost. = 
 # Requires translation!
Since this determines how quickly you can build more stuff, your Nation's Production Capacity is crucial to it's advancement and survival. = 

 # Requires translation!
⍾Science is the resource that unlocks new and exciting Technologies for your Nation. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once you've Founded your Capital, you'll be prompted to Pick a Technology to Research. = 
 # Requires translation!
Every Technology costs an amount of ⍾Science. Every turn the ⍾Science your Nation produces is paid towards Researching your chosen Technology. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once a Technology has it's cost fully paid, you unlock the benefits for your Nation! This could be new Units, Buildings, or other advantages. Any surplus will overflow into the next Technology you pick to Research. = 
 # Requires translation!
Researching a Technology in the next Era will advance you into that Era and trigger a notification to other Nations about how amazing you are! = 
 # Requires translation!
Since new Technologies tend to give access to better Units, Buildings, and even unlock powerful new Policies, staying ahead of the competition is one of the best ways to secure your Victory! = 

 # Requires translation!
Ah Gold. The Universal Medium of Exchange. Everyone loves Gold! They say it can't buy Happiness, but nuclear submarines are almost as good. = 
 # Requires translation!
You can earn more Gold from Tiles, Resources, Improvements, and eventually Buildings, Specialists, and Trade Routes. Ancient Ruins, meeting new City-States, and Pillaging are also great sources of Gold. During a Golden Age every Tile that already yields Gold will yield an additional Gold! = 
 # Requires translation!
Gold is how you pay for Building Maintenance, Transportation Upkeep, and Unit Upkeep. If you run out of Gold, first you'll receive penalties to your ⍾Science production, then eventually your Units will start Disbanding as you can't pay their upkeep. = 
 # Requires translation!
Gold can be used to Buy Buildings and Units, helping bring up a new City or quickly build an Army. It can also buy Tiles to add to your City. It's also used to Upgrade your units from their older, obsolete forms to new, stronger versions. And investing it into a Research Agreement is a great way to convert it into ⍾Science. = 
 # Requires translation!
Gold is also very valuable in Diplomacy. You can directly Gift Gold to City-States to gain their favor. Use it to balance a Trade Deal with other Nations. Or demand every last drop after a successful war and your enemy sues for peace. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ironically, some may consider Gold to be one of the less important Resources. But it's flexible nature and importance to keep your Nation running makes it a precious thing to pay attention to. After all, everyone loves Gold. =

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 隨著城市規模擴大，城市的可工作地塊也會變得越來越多。\n這時，你將不得不面對遊戲中關於“快樂”的機制。在遊戲中，快樂的產出是所有城市總和計算，\n快樂的消耗則由城市數量和人口數量決定。\n隨著城市數量的增加和城市人口的增長您將會很快發現：保持你的文明始終處於快樂是一件越來越難的事。
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 此外，在未研發相關科技前您將無法建造任何能增加快樂的建築、奇觀和開發可以增加快樂的奢侈資源。\n如果您的文明處於不滿，將會極大地減慢城市發展速度。\n如果文明的不滿狀態非常嚴重(頂部資訊欄用一個“哭臉”標示)，\n您的部隊戰鬥力將會有極大的減成。
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 這意味著在 Unciv中快速擴張是非常困難的。\n雖然這並非不可能，但作為一個新玩家，你可能不應該這樣做。\n那你應該怎麼做？放鬆、偵察和通過建築工人來改善你所擁有的土地。\n只有在找到你認為合適的地點後才建造新城市。

Unhappiness = 不滿
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 看來你的公民們很不開心！\n在不開心的同時，你們的文明會遭受許多不利影響，隨著不開心的程度越來越高，嚴重程度也會越來越高。
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 產生不滿的原因有兩個:人口數和城市數，\n每座城市產生3點不滿，每個市民產生1點不滿。
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 有 2 種主要方法可以對抗不快樂：\n 為您的人民建造增加快樂值的建築\n或增加您境內的奢侈品資源。

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 您的文明進入了一個黃金時代!\n您的快樂每個回合都會積累，\n當快樂積累到一定數值就會開啟一個黃金時代。\n在黃金時代，文化和產能積累速率+20%，\n每個至少產出1金錢的地塊將額外提供1金錢。

Roads and Railroads = 道路與鐵路
 # Requires translation!
Roads reduce the Movement Points required to move between two tiles connected by Roads. = 
 # Requires translation!
Railroads improve this reduction even more! = 
 # Requires translation!
This greatly improves the speed you can get Units around the map. = 
 # Requires translation!
Until you research the technology that removes it, Roads do not cross Rivers = 
 # Requires translation!
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. = 
 # Requires translation!
However, since each Road and Railroad have a Maintenance Cost, it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow and only place where needed. = 

 # Requires translation!
Trade Route = 
 # Requires translation!
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. You earn more Gold the more Population the City and your Capital has. = 
 # Requires translation!
Note that each road costs 1 Gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 Gold, so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 
 # Requires translation!
Railroads connecting a city to the Capital also provide a 25% Production Boost to the City, but not the Capital. = 
 # Requires translation!
Trade Routes are also connected over Water via certain buildings like the Harbor. As long as there is a chain that can reach the Capital, there's a Trade Route. Look for this symbol in Yellow below the City Name to mean you have an active Trade Route to your Capital. = 
 # Requires translation!
Trade Routes can get broken either by Blockades or by Removing/Pillaging the connecting Road/Railroad chain. =

Victory Types = 獲取勝利的方法
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 當您建立了兩三座城市後，可能已經經過了100～150回合，\n這時您應該思考和謀劃如何贏得遊戲的勝利--如果此時你還沒有勝利的話！
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 在 Unciv 中有四種獲勝方式。它們是：\n - 文化勝利：完成 5 項社會政策樹(分支)並建立烏托邦計劃\n - 統治勝利：作為最後生存的文明\n - 科學勝利：成為第一個建造通往半人馬座α星的太空飛船\n - 外交 勝利：建立聯合國並贏得選票。
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 總而言之，這些就是 Unciv 的基礎——建立一個繁榮的城市，慢慢擴張以維持快樂值，並為自己想要追求的勝利條件做好準備。\n顯然，實際的遊戲遠遠不止於此，但重要的是，在你不會游泳之前不要跳入深水區。

Enemy City = 敵方城市
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 您已經包圍了敵人的一座城市!\n當城市的耐久降至1時就可以被佔領。\n只能使用近戰單位佔領城市。\n城市每回合會自動回復少許耐久，所以最好先使用遠端單位攻擊它，\n同時使用您的近戰單位來保護遠端單位，直到城市被佔領!

Luxury Resource = 奢侈資源
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 你的領土內的奢侈資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的奢侈資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n您擁有的每種獨一無二的奢侈資源都會給您的文明+5快樂，\n每種奢侈資源只能提供一份快樂加成，數量超過1的同種資源並不會提供更多的快樂，\n所以用它們和其他文明進行貿易吧!

Strategic Resource = 戰略資源
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 你的領土內的戰略資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的戰略資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n建造/訓練特定的項目(單位/建築)時將會消耗相應的戰略資源。如需要消耗1單位的馬來訓練1個騎手單位，\n沒有馬就不能訓練騎手。當該單位或建築被摧毀時，此資源將能再次使用。\n如果獲取資源途徑出現中斷，需要該資源的單位將受到戰鬥力減成，直至重新獲得該資源。
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 與奢侈資源不同，地圖上顯示的每個戰略資源圖示將提供多於1單位的該種資源。\n頂部資訊欄顯示了你擁有多少未使用的戰略資源。\n在概覽介面點擊“資源”按鈕可以查看你所擁有資源的完整資訊。

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 這座城市再也不能抵抗了!\n然而，要征服城市，請使用您的近戰單位佔領它。

After Conquering = 佔領城市的處理
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 當征服了一座城市，您可以選擇解放、併吞、傀儡甚至摧毀它。
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = \n解放城市會將城市歸還其原擁有者，並且大幅提升外交關係！\n\n併吞城市會使你獲得城市完整控制權，但會使居民不滿度乘2倍！\n在城市中建造法院將消除不滿度懲罰。\n\n傀儡城市意味無法控制城市生產。\n被傀儡的城市不會增加額外科技和社會政策開銷。\n一個被傀儡的城市可以隨時被併吞，但被併吞的城市無法回到傀儡狀態。\n\n摧毀城市會使每回合減少1人口，直到其被夷平！\n您無法摧毀一個文明起始城市或該宗教的聖城。

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 您遇到蠻族了！\n蠻族會不分青紅皂白地攻擊靠近它的每一個單位，\n所以請不要讓您的移民等平民單位靠近他們，同時還要注意你的斥候！

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 您遇到了另一個文明!\n其他文明一開始是和平的，您可以和他們進行貿易，\n但是他們以後可能會選擇對您宣戰。

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 當您完成了阿波羅計畫，可以開始在您的城市中建造飛船部件(需要相應科技)，\n來通過太空競賽贏得科技勝利！

Injured Units = 受傷單位
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 受傷的單位造成的傷害較少，但該回合他們若處於駐守狀態，則會恢復生命值。\n單位在敵方領土或中立土地上每回合治療 10 點生命值，\n 在你的領土內為 20 點，在你的城市內為 25 點。

Workers = 工人
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 工人對您所在城市的發展至關重要，因為只有他們才能在地塊上建造設施。\n設施可以提高地塊的產出，\n當市民在建有設施的地塊工作時，將給您的城市帶來更多的收益，同時城市也會發展得更快。

Siege Units = 攻城者單位
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 攻城單位對城市具有極強的毀滅力，但在進攻前必須先把它架設起來。\n您的攻城單位架設起來後，它就可以從當前的地塊發起攻擊，\n但是一旦它移動到其他地塊，就需要重新架設。

Embarking = 陸軍單位的船運
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 一旦研究了某種特定的技術，你的陸地單位就可以上船，讓他們穿越水域。\n進入或離開水域需要整個回合。
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 單位在船上時沒有防禦能力，只能根據你的科技時代具有固定的防禦力量，所以要看好你在水中的單位！\n遠程單位不能攻擊，近戰單位有力量削弱，並且都有有限的視野。

Idle Units = 空閒單位
 # Requires translation!
Clicking 'Next unit' moves to the next idle unit in the queue (as listed in Overview -> Units). After issuing an order to an unit, if 'Auto Unit Cycle' in Options -> Gameplay is enabled, you will automatically select the next idle unit. =

If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again, or command the unit to 'Skip turn'. = 
 # Requires translation!
If you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Options -> Gameplay -> Check for idle units. =

You can also cycle through the idle units using the left and right triangles on the Unit Table in the lower left of the screen. Or by default using the Cycle button next to the 'Next Unit' button. = 

Contact Me = 聯繫我吧！
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n Unciv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 很好!當您已經熟悉了遊戲的全部內容，\n您會發現遊戲目前是不完整的，它還處於開發狀態。\n不過Unciv將永遠是開源和免費的，\n這意味著您無須擔心廣告或付費問題。
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 您的支持將激勵著我進一步完善它，\n我一定會竭盡全力、精益求精。\n感謝玩家們的支持--您們是最棒的!

Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 如果喜歡它，請到Play Store對它進行評價。\n如果您發現了遊戲存在的問題或有什麼好的意見和建議，\n請聯繫我！\n我的email地址：yairm210@hotmail.com，\nGitHub專案頁面：https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv。

Pillaging = 劫掠
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 軍隊可以劫掠設施，同時恢復25點血量並奪取資源。被劫掠的地塊仍可以有基本的地塊產出，但原本從設施獲得的額外產出 - 比如資源加成和戰略資源 - 將無法獲得。\n工人可以修復這些設施，修復所需時間比建造的時間少。\n劫掠某些設施可以為你帶來金錢的收入。

Experience = 經驗
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 戰鬥中單位獲得的經驗可用於該單位的晉升。\n單位在近戰攻擊時獲得的經驗大於遠端攻擊時，在進攻時獲得的經驗大於防禦時。
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 單個單位與蠻族單位戰鬥時最多可獲得30經驗值-這意味著最多2次晉升。在那之後，該單位與蠻族單位戰鬥將不會獲得任何經驗。

Combat = 戰鬥
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 單位和城市都會因戰鬥而損傷，戰鬥受到許多不同因素的影響。\n每個單位都有一個特定的“基礎”戰鬥值用於戰鬥結算，該數值受遊戲難度設置、單位擁有的晉升技能、所處的位置等因素影響。
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 當近戰攻擊和防禦時，單位使用“戰鬥力”作為“基礎”戰鬥值。\n當進行遠端攻擊時，單位使用“遠端戰鬥力”作為“基礎”戰鬥值。
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 遠端攻擊可以在遠距離進行，這取決於單位的“攻擊範圍”。\n近戰攻擊時防禦者會對攻擊者造成反擊傷害，遠程攻擊則不會。

Research Agreements = 科研協定
 # Requires translation!
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of ⍾Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 科研協定的收益取決於協定期間科研產出總量較小的那個文明——因此，選擇簽訂科研協定物件時請慎重！
 # Requires translation!
Note that before you can invest in a research agreement, you must have a Declaraction of Friendship, both Nations need the required Technology, and both Nations need enough Gold on hand for the agreement. = 

 # Requires translation!
Defensive Pacts = 
 # Requires translation!
Defensive pacts allow you and another civ to protect one another from aggressors.\nOnce the defensive pact is signed, you will be drawn into their future defensive wars, just as they will be drawn into your future defensive wars. Declaring war on any Civ will remove all of your defensive pacts. You will have to re-sign them to use their effect. = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when signing defensive pacts because they can bring you into wars that you might not want to be in. = 
 # Requires translation!
The AI is very careful and will not accept defensive pacts with less than 80 influence. = 

Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, can't be traded with, and instead confer certain bonuses to friendly civilizations. = 不是所有的國家都和您競爭勝利。\n城邦國家無法獲勝，無法交易，但能給予友好文明特定的獎勵。
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 相反，與城邦的外交關係取決於影響力——一個表示“城邦有多喜歡你”的數值。\n與他們的敵人戰鬥，解放他們的城市，或者給予他們一大筆金錢，都可以增加你對他們的影響力。
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 當影響力超過30時，根據城邦類型的不同您會獲得相應的獎勵。\n當影響力超過60，並且在所有文明中您對他們的影響力最高時，您將被他們視為“盟友”，可獲得更多的獎勵效果，同時還可以使用他們領土上的奢侈資源和戰略資源。

 # Requires translation!
While working the land is good, eventually your Citizens will want to Specialize. = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain Buildings will also provide Specialist Slots. These slots will show up in the Citizen Management within the City Screen under Specialists. Each slot can be filled with a Citizen which will then become a Specialist. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each Specialist will generate a certain amount of yield as indicated to the right of the available slots. = 
 # Requires translation!
While these are a great way to specialize the yield production of a City outside of the surrounding Tile Yields, Specialists have an additional value. Each one also generates Great Person Points each turn. With enough of them, a new Great Person will join your Nation. =

Great People = 偉人
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = 特定的建築和城市中的專業人員，每回合會產生偉人點數。\n不同類型的偉人，他們的點數積累分別獨立計算。\n每回合可獲得的偉人點數和已積累的偉人點數可以在概覽介面查看。
 # Requires translation!
Alternatively, the Great Person points breakdown per city can be viewed in each City Screen (see UI Tips article). = 
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 一旦積累了足夠的點數，一位該類型的偉人將誕生！\n每位偉人都可以建造偉大的設施，隨著時間的推移產生大量收益，或者立即消耗以提供一定的獎勵。
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 偉人設施同時還有開發其所在地塊戰略資源的功能，所以請不必擔心偉人設施所在地塊的戰略資源開發問題！

Removing Terrain Features = 清除地貌
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = 部分方塊擁有額外的地形特徵 - 例如氾濫平原或森林 - 疊加於其上方。部分的地形特徵，例如叢林、沼澤和森林可以透過工人清除。\n清除這些地形特徵不會移除任何在此方塊的資源，而且通常在開發這些資源前必須先移除這些特徵。

 # Requires translation!
Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, ⍾Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 

Keyboard = 鍵盤

Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = 每個文明只能選擇一個萬神殿信仰，並且每個萬神殿只能選擇一次。
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = 產生更多的☮信仰將允許您創建一個宗教。

Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = 持續地產生☮信仰，將會在您的某座城市中誕生一位大先知。
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = 大先知在多個方面都有用處：建造聖地、創建宗教和傳播宗教。
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = 當您創建自己的宗教後，您可以選擇另外兩種信仰。創始者信仰僅適用於您自己，而追隨者信仰則適用於所有遵循您宗教的城市。
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = 此外，您使用大先知的城市將成為該宗教的聖城。
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = 一旦您建立了一種宗教，大先知將會不斷地誕生，即使您必須儲存的☮信仰值將會越來越高。
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = 這些大先知中的任何一位皆可強化您的宗教。
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = 這將允許您選擇另一個追隨者信仰，以及一個只適用於您自己的強化信仰。
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = 請注意盡快創立一個宗教，遊戲中只有大約一半的玩家能夠建立一個宗教！

Beliefs = 信仰
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = 信仰有四種類型：萬神殿、創始人、追隨者和增強者信仰。
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = 萬神殿和追隨者信仰適用於遵循您宗教的每座城市，而創始者和增強者信仰僅適用於宗教的創始者。

Religion inside cities = 城市中的宗教
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = 當建立一座城市時，它不會立即信奉一種宗教。
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = 一個城市所信奉的宗教取決於每個宗教在城市內的總壓力。
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the City Screen. = 信徒按照與這些壓力相同的比例分配，可以在城市介面查看這些信徒。
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = 您可以透過選擇該城市的方式來瞭解不屬於您城市的信仰人口及宗教壓力。
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = 透過點擊這兩者宗教圖示都可以顯示其詳細資訊及效果。
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = 根據這些資訊，您可以瞭解一個城市的那些宗教給予高度的壓力，而那些宗教則幾乎沒有影響力。
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = 一個城市內的主要人口都信仰一宗教時，該城市才會跟隨該宗教，並且才會獲得該宗教追隨者和萬神殿的影響。

Spreading Religion = 傳播宗教
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = 宗教的傳播是自然發生的，但可以通過傳教士或大先知來加速。
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 傳教士可以在有宗教信仰的都市購買，並且會跟隨該宗教。
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = 當您購買傳教士時必須小心。如果另一個文明改變您的城市信仰，購買的傳教士將會追隨他們的信仰。
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = 大先知會永遠跟隨您的信仰，即使該大先知在一個不是追隨您信仰的城市中購買，但被俘虜的大先知不會改變原本其信仰。
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = 一旦進入城市邊界，大先知和傳教士都可以傳播信仰，即使該城市屬於其它文明。
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = 這兩個單位甚至可以進入未和您簽屬開放邊境協定的文明地塊。
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 但請注意，傳教士在其它文明領土時每回合會損失250點信仰值。
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 這將會降低傳教士傳播信仰的效率，且當信仰值到達0後，他們將會失去信念並消失。
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 當您傳播宗教時，該單位的信仰值會增加至該宗教的壓力。
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = 城市也會被動的受到來自於周遭城市主要信仰的壓力。
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = 每個城市在10個地塊距離內每回合施予 +6 的信仰壓力，實際上的壓力值依據遊戲速度而有變化。
This pressure can also be seen in the City Screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 這個壓力值可以透過城市介面得知，並提供在甚麼都不做的情況下，在您城市中的宗教演化概況。
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 聖城提供 +30 的宗教壓力給予自己，使其難以被有效率的改變信仰。
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 最後，在創立宗教前，您建立的新城市將會獲得萬神教的200點壓力。
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 在此情況下，只要您還沒建立宗教，您建立的新城市都會追隨您的萬神殿。

Inquisitors = 審判官
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = 審判官是最後一個宗教單位，他們的力量是清除其他宗教。
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = 他們可以清除您城市內的其它宗教，清除所有已建立的宗教壓力。
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = 大先知也有這個能力，他們傳播信仰的同時也會清除其它所有宗教。
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = 通常會導致這個城市立刻轉換宗教信仰。
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is unaffected. = 此外，當一個審判官駐守或緊鄰一個城市時，其它宗教單位無法傳播他們的信仰，但自然傳播不在此限。

The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 瑪雅獨有的'長紀曆'有一些副作用：
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 一但啟用後，遊戲上的年份將使用瑪雅符號顯示
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 瑪雅的創世日期為西元前3114年8月11日。1天叫'金'、20金為'烏納'、18烏納為'盾'、20盾為'卡頓'、20卡頓為'伯克盾'、20伯克盾為'皮卡盾'...，以此類推
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = 本遊戲只會顯示ය 伯克盾, ඹ 卡盾 和 ම 盾 (由左至右)，如此足以近似公曆年。瑪雅數字很容易理解。祝你解碼愉快！

Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 你的城市會周期性地需要不同的奢侈品來滿足他們對生活中新事物的渴望。
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = 如果您設法通過貿易、擴張或征服獲得所需的奢侈品，城市將慶祝我們愛國王日 20 回合。
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 在我們愛國王日期間，這座城市的增長速度將加快 25%。
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = 這意味著探索和貿易對於發展您的城市很重要！

Air Combat and Interception = 空戰與空中攔截
Air Combat is very similar to normal Combat, with a few wrinkles. Damage is still dealt using the same equations based on the relative Strength of the Attacking and Defending Unit. = 空戰與一般戰鬥非常相似，卻有些許不同。傷害仍以同一個基於攻守雙方相對強度的方程式計算。
However, before the Attacker and Defender fight, there is an added combat phase called Interception. If there is any unit with Interception Range that covers the target attacked tile, then it will attempt to Intercept the Attacking Air Unit. If multiple units can Intercept, the one with higher Intercept chance does it. = 然而，在攻守雙方交戰前添加了稱作“攔截”的階段。如果任何單位的攔截範圍涵括該攻擊目標地塊，其將會試圖攔截攻擊方的空中單位。假如存在複數能進行攔截的單位，其中攔截率較高者將進行攔截。
Generally Land/Naval Units have an Intercept Range of 2 Tiles, and Air Units have an Intercept Range of their Attack Range. = 一般而言，陸地或海軍單位的攔截範圍為 2 格地塊，而空軍單位具有等同於其攻擊範圍的攔截範圍。
Ground and Naval Units don't require movement points to Intercept, just Attacks. Air Units cannot have moved nor attacked in the preceding turn. = 陸地或海軍單位無需移動點數即可進行攔截，惟攻擊時需要。空軍單位必須沒有在上個回合攻擊或移動過才行。
The Intercepting Unit rolls to see if it hits. Whether it hits or not costs an Attack, and most units (without Promotions) can only Attack Once per Nation's Turn. It does NOT cost Movement Points, but Air Units that have used their Movement cannot Intercept between turns. = 以隨機方式決定該攔截單位是否擊中。無論擊中與否皆視為消耗一次攻擊，而大部分（無晉升）單位僅可在每個國家的回合中各攻擊一次。這並不會消耗移動點數，但空軍單位在上一個回合行動過的話則無法於回合之間進行攔截。
If the Intercepting Unit Hits, it deals damage according to the Combat Strength calculation to the Attacking Air Unit, potentially with any Strength Bonuses that apply to Interception. It does not receive damage from the Attacking Air Unit. = 若該攔截單位擊中目標，則依據戰鬥強度計算其給予攻擊方空中單位的傷害，並適用所有攔截加成。它不會受到來自此攻擊方空中單位的傷害。
After Interception resolves, the Attacking Air Unit and the Defending Unit in the targeted tile do Combat as normal, with damage dealt to both sides. = 結束攔截後，攻擊方的空中單位將與位在目標地塊上的防守方單位進行一般對戰，雙方各自承受傷害。
To help deal with Interceptions, see Air Sweeps. = 想知道如何處理空中攔截，請參閱“空中掃蕩”。

Air Sweeps = 空中掃蕩
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = 戰鬥機單位能夠在一個地塊上執行空中掃蕩，協助清理可以威脅到此地塊的敵對空中、海上或陸上單位的潛在攔截。
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = 當這個攻擊動作發動時，將會引誘攔截者們以保護您的空中單位，特別是轟炸機。
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = 如果有單位能抵達此地塊，您的單位將總是引誘出攔截者，即使攔截單位可能攔截失敗。
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = 如果攔截單位不是空中單位(例如地面或海上)，則雙方都不會受到傷害。
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = 如果攔截單位是空中單位，則雙方會在沒有攔截加乘的戰鬥中受到傷害。只有發起空中掃蕩的單位獲得空中掃蕩加乘。

Fortify, Guard, Withdraw = 
 # Requires translation!
Most Land units have the ability to Fortify. As they spend time without moving, they will slowly gain a Fortification Bonus to their Combat Strength representing digging in and preparing in case of an attack. = 
 # Requires translation!
Some units have the ability to Withdraw before a melee attack is struck. However, perhaps you wish for them to stand their ground to protect a particular tile. If you do, then give them the Guard command and they will stay fixed until they die or you give them fresh orders. = 
 # Requires translation!
This is NOT the same as Fortify but they will still gain the Fortification Bonus. They will simply not utilize their Withdraw ability. Fortified units with the Withdraw ability will try to flee when attacked. = 

City Tile Blockade = 城市地塊封鎖
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = 你的某些地塊被敵人封鎖了：當敵軍站在你擁有的地塊時，該地塊將沒有任何產出，並且本回合不能被城市利用。城市將自動從被封鎖的地塊上重新分配人口。
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = 敵方的陸地軍事單位將封鎖他們所處在的地塊。敵方的海軍部隊還會封鎖相鄰的水域。為了保護你的地塊不被封鎖，可以在地塊上放置一友好的軍事單位，或擊退入侵者。

City Blockade = 城市封鎖
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = 你的某些城市被水路封鎖了！——當沿海城市的所有相鄰水域被封鎖時，該城市將失去與所有其他城市的港口聯繫，包括首都。請確保通過部署友軍海軍部隊擊退入侵者來解除對城市的封鎖。

Spies! = 隔牆有耳！
The first time a civ reaches the Renaissance era each nation gets one spy. Every time a civ reaches an era afterwards they get one more spy. = 首次有文明發展至文藝復興時代時，各國獲得一名間諜。此後每當有文明進入更晚期的時代，各國再獲得一名間諜。
Spies can be sent out to foreign cities to steal technology, rigging elections or stage coups. Place them in your own cities to do counter-intelligence work. = 間諜可被派遣至外國城市以竊取科技、操縱選舉或策動政變。將他們置於己方城市以進行反情報工作。
Only one spy per civ is allowed in each city. Spies that are not in any city are on vacation in your spy hideout. = 在同個城市中，每個文明僅可派遣一名間諜。不在城市中的間諜則在我方間諜的藏匿處休假。
Spies set up in cities of major civilizations will try to steal technology at a rate which is based off of the science production in the city. Succeeding to steal technology will level up your spy. Failing to succeed will level up the defending spy if it is present. = 在主要文明的城市中的間諜會試圖竊取科技，成功率以該城市的科研產量為基礎進行計算。若成功竊取科技則會使我方間諜升級。若失敗則會使防禦方的間諜升級（前提是該防禦方有派駐間諜）。
Spies set in city-states will try to rig the elections in order to gain influence and reduce the influence of other civilizations. Only one spy partaking in rigging the election can win. = 在城邦的間諜會試圖操縱選舉以增強影響力並削弱其他文明的影響力。參與某次選舉的間諜之中僅會有一名獲勝者。
A spy that is rigging an election in a city-state may also stage a coup. The likelihood of success for the coup depends on your relative influence to the current ally of the city-state, your spy level, and the level of the spy that the current ally has in the city-state if present. Succeeding a coup will make you their new ally and reduce the influence of all other civs. Failing a coup will kill your spy and level up the defending spy if present. = 在城邦操縱選舉的間諜也可以策動政變。政變的成功率取決於我方與該城邦當前盟友的相對影響力及我方間諜等級，若該當前盟友在當地派駐間諜，則亦計算其等級。
Spies that are set up in your own cities will be conducting counter-intelligence. They reduce the success chance of other spies trying to steal your technology. = 在我方城市中的間諜會進行反情報工作。這樣會使其他間諜竊取我方科技的成功率降低。
Spies at a higher rank have a higher chance of success. The max rank a spy can reach is rank 3. After a spy is killed it will revive after a certain amount of turns back at rank 1. = 愈高階的間諜成功率愈高。間諜的最高階級為 3 。遭到殺害的間諜會在經過特定回合後恢復，並回到階級 1。
Building buildings like the constabulary and police station will reduce the technology steal rate of spies in that city. = 諸如民警或警察局等的建築會降低間諜在該城市竊取科技的成功率。
Espionage is available using the Gods and Kings ruleset. To enable it in a new game click advanced settings, then click on the Enable Espionage option. = 間諜在國王與眾神規則集下可用。想在新遊戲中啟用的話要先點擊進階設置，然後點擊“啟用間諜”。

Keyboard Bindings = 快捷鍵綁定

Differences from Civilization V = 與《文明V》的不同之處
 # Requires translation!
Production Focus\nIn Civilization V, the Food yield in a city is calculated first, then population grows by consuming stored food (growth), then production is calculated, and so on one by one the other stats are calculated. Thus, citizens can produce yields in the same turn as they are born. The city focus is set to Production to assign the newborn citizen to a hill so they'll contribute Production, and then manually reassigned to a growth tile on the next turn. Alternatively, you can set city focus to Gold (e.g. with Cerro de Potosi), Faith (e.g. with Mount Sinai) or whatever gains the most yields. In Unciv, citizens only start producing yields on the next turn, so you can ignore this whole concept. = 
 # Requires translation!
Science Queueing\nIn Civilization V, Science yield is calculated after production, so if you finish an item and have Science (or Gold) queued as a perpetual construction, the Production overflow from item will be converted into Science (or Gold), but the Production is not consumed, as this will only happen again on the next turn. By immediately swapping out your perpetual construction for an item on the next turn, you'll get this Science (or Gold) for free. This doesn't apply to Unciv, so don't bother. = 
 # Requires translation!
Double Aqueducts\nIn Civilization V, the game sells existing copies of the building for you before providing a free copy of the building. So, if you build an aqueduct in a city, and then in the turn of adopting Tradition Complete you sell a cheap building (e.g a shrine) beforehand, the game is unable to sell more than 1 building per turn, and thus you'll keep your aqueduct, together with the new free aqueduct. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Legalism Oxford\nIn Civilization V, national wonders such as Oxford University are considered culture buildings, so you can get them for free with Legalism. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Roads and Forts\nIn Civilization V, you can't use roads and forts in enemy territory. In Unciv, you can use them, so instead of mindlessly constructing them everywhere when at war, you need to decide if and when they'll benefit you more than your opponents. = 
 # Requires translation!
Citizen Conversion\nIn Civilization V, a citizen is born religious if the parent city is already converted. This is not the case in Unciv, which can lead to temporary deconversion of a city when it grows. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unassigned Citizens\nIn Civilization V, unassigned citizens are considered specialists, and subject to the same type of bonuses (e.g. Korea's ability). It can be worthwhile to leave citizens unassigned, instead of being assigned to a tile. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Settler Construction\nIn Civilization V, cities can't starve when constructing settlers, so you can assign all citizens to production tiles and none to food tiles. In Unciv, citizens keep consuming two food per turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Water Melee Attack\nAs result of a Discord poll, Water Melee units can attack military land units on the shore, unlike in Civilization V. = 
 # Requires translation!
Tile improvements\nIn Civilzation V, workers start working on an improvement-under-construction at the beginning of movement. Unciv changes this, to allow players to assign workers to tiles, and then reconsider and change improvement or move them elsewhere. = 
 # Requires translation!
Forest and Jungle Visibility\nIn Unciv, forests and jungles are visible 1 tile outside visibility range. In Civilization V, this is the behaviour of hills and mountains, but not of forests and jungles, yet jungle and forest can block hills, and hill + forest can block mountain, indicating they're on the same elevation. This is considered to be a bug in the otherwise well-structured visibility logic in Civilization V. = 

 # Requires translation!
Founding Cities\nThe Settler is a unit that can found a new city. You can build a Settler unit in a city with at least 2 population, and then move them to a good location to found a new city. This will usually be your main way of acquiring more cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Food conversion to Production\nDuring the construction of a Settler, the city will not grow. Instead, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and from there on every 4th, excess Food (Growth) is converted into Production, with the rest of the excess Food being lost. =
