Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10,000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, however, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks who fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and through a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological superiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! =

Blessings of God be upon you, oh Great Emperor Suleiman! Your power, wealth and generosity awe the world! Truly, are you called 'Magnificent!' Your empire began in Bithynia, a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century. Taking advantage in the decline of the great Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, King Osman I of Bithynia expanded west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your subjects brought down the empire of Byzantium, taking its holdings in Turkey and then the Balkans. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans captured ancient Constantinople, gaining control of the strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. Your people's empire would continue to expand for centuries governing much of North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height. =

Surrounded by many tribes fighting to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zampango, through cunning alliances and martial prowess, within a mere two hundred years, the Aztecs came to dominate the Central American basin, ruling a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea. But the empire fell at last under the assault of foreign devils - the accursed Spaniards! - wielding fiendish weapons the likes of which your faithful warriors had never seen. =

Introduction = 遊戲介紹
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 您好，歡迎來到絢麗多彩的UnCiv遊戲世界！\n文明遊戲是複雜的，讓我們通過一些簡單的任務來熟悉它吧。\n這些任務是可選的，當然您也可以自己探索遊戲世界！

New Game = 開始新遊戲
Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = 您的第一個任務是建立首都，\n這個任務是非常重要的，因為通常情況下首都會成為你的文明最繁榮的城市。\n遊戲中解鎖政策、科技等帶來的很多增益往往只對首都有效，所以首都的發展代表了您的文明的發達程度。
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to watch out for! = 如何選擇一個合適的首都建立位置？這不是一個容易回答的問題。\n通常情況下，選擇緊鄰奢侈資源的位置是選擇建立點的不二法則。\n奢侈資源主要包括寶石、棉花、絲綢等(這些資源在地圖上用一個“笑臉”標示)，\n開發這些資源可以增加您的文明的快樂。當然，你也應該留意那些訓練單位時所需要的戰略資源，比如鐵。
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = 但是，城市的邊界不是固定的，它會隨著文化的積累慢慢擴張。\n這意味著你並不一定要把城市建在太過靠近資源的位置。\n舉例來說，比如, 你需要獲得戰略資源鐵--但悲劇的是該資源緊鄰沙漠。\n您無需把城市建立在緊鄰沙漠的位置。相反的，可以選擇離該資源稍遠而且更加富饒的地塊。\n隨著城市的不斷繁榮發展和邊界的擴張，城市將慢慢靠近該資源直至獲得它。\n如果需要馬上獲得所需的戰略資源你可以選擇建城在靠近資源的位置--\n有時候這樣做可能對遊戲的勝利更有利，但通常情況下您都有充裕的時間選擇更加合理的建立點。
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = 您的城市第一個訓練的單位應當是勇士或斥候。\n我非常喜歡勇士，因為他可以用於防守，\n同時在研發“鐵器”科技後只需花少量的金錢就可以把他升級為劍士。\n當您的城市位於大片森林或丘陵間時斥候是非常有效的選擇，\n因為他在這些地形移動時沒有移動力懲罰。\n如果您是4x遊戲的行家裡手，緊隨第一個勇士或斥候的單位應該是移民。\n請記住：快速擴張永遠是獲取勝利的不二法門！

In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention = 在遊戲開始的最初幾回合，\n您只需進行很少的操作。\n但隨著您的文明的發展，\n很多事情必須面面俱到。

Culture and Policies = 文化與政策
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 文化可以通過建設文化建築或奇觀、推行社會政策等積累。\n當您有足夠的文化時, 可以推行一項社會政策，\n每項社會政策都給您一定的獎勵。
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 社會政策被劃分成幾個分支，每個分支都有自己的子政策，\n當一個分支社會政策的所有子政策都被推行，\n會有一個額外的獎勵。
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 隨著每項社會政策的推行，每座城市的建立，\n推行新的社會政策時的文化花費會隨之提升--所以要明智地選擇!

City Expansion = 城市擴張
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 當一個城市積累了足夠的文化時，城市的邊界就會擴張一個臨近地塊。\n您無法控制它將擴張到哪個地塊，但系統會優先考慮擁有資源和更高產出收益的地塊。
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 每擴張一個地塊都需要更多的文化，但一般來說，你的第一個城市最終會擴張到擁有一個廣闊的領土範圍。
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 雖然你的城市將會永遠擴張下去，但你的市民只能在距離城市中心3格內的地塊上工作。\n在建立新城市時應考慮到這一點。

As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 隨著城市規模擴大，城市的可工作地塊也會變得越來越多。\n這時，你將不得不面對遊戲中關於“快樂”的機制。在遊戲中，快樂的產出是所有城市總和計算，\n快樂的消耗則由城市數量和人口數量決定。\n隨著城市數量的增加和城市人口的增長您將會很快發現：保持你的文明始終處於快樂是一件越來越難的事。
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 此外，在未研發相關科技前您將無法建造任何能增加快樂的建築、奇觀和開發可以增加快樂的奢侈資源。\n如果您的文明處於不滿，將會極大地減慢城市發展速度。\n如果文明的不滿狀態非常嚴重(頂部資訊欄用一個“哭臉”標示)，\n您的部隊戰鬥力將會有極大的減成。
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn’t do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 這意味著在Unciv遊戲中快速擴張是一件非常困難的事，新手們一定要十分慎重。\n那麼究竟應該如何做呢？把目光聚焦在發展自己已有的城市上吧。\n通過訓練工人建造設施、開發資源，同時不要放鬆對其他文明的偵查工作，\n只有當您在尋找到一個合適的位置後再來建立新的城市吧。

Unhappiness = 不滿
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, cities  will grow at 1/4 the speed, and your units will suffer a 2% penalty for each unhappiness = 看來您的市民不太高興!\n因為不滿(快樂為負)，城市的食物產出將-75%，\n每1點不滿會使您的單位戰鬥力-2%。
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 產生不滿的原因有兩個:人口數和城市數，\n每座城市產生3點不滿，每個市民產生1點不滿。
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders = 有兩種方法可以減少不滿:\n為您的市民建造提供快樂的建築或奇觀，\n或者開發奢侈資源。

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 您的文明進入了一個黃金時代!\n您的快樂每個回合都會積累，\n當快樂積累到一定數值就會開啟一個黃金時代。\n在黃金時代，文化和產能積累速率+20%，\n每個至少產出1金錢的地塊將額外提供1金錢。

Roads and Railroads = 道路與鐵路
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 您已經建立了第二座城市!\n通過道路連接您的城市和首都來建立貿易路線，\n貿易路線將提供額外的金錢產出。\n請注意，道路經過的每個地塊都需要1金錢的維護費，\n所以等待城市的自然發展可能更經濟!

Victory Types = 獲取勝利的方法
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 當您建立了兩三座城市後，可能已經經過了100～150回合，\n這時您應該思考和謀劃如何贏得遊戲的勝利--如果此時你還沒有勝利的話！
There are three ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri = 在Unciv遊戲中，有三種贏得勝利的方式。分別是：\n文化勝利--完成5個社會政策分支；\n征服勝利--消滅其他文明成為世界上唯一的存在；\n科技勝利--成為第一個建造太空飛船飛向遙遠的半人馬阿爾法星的文明。
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness,\n   and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 小心謀劃、認真算計、穩紮穩打、步步為營，這是遊玩Unciv遊戲的基本法則。\n首先建立一座繁榮的城市，確保快樂不為負的情況下慢慢擴張，漸漸成長為一方強權，\n向著你設定的勝利目標勇敢前進吧！\n這是勇敢者的遊戲，需要的不僅是智謀和勇氣，請盡情享受吧！不過，請注意：魯莽與草率是通向死亡的快車道！

Enemy City = 敵方城市
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 您已經包圍了敵人的一座城市!\n當城市的耐久降至1時就可以被佔領。\n只能使用近戰單位佔領城市。\n城市每回合會自動回復少許耐久，所以最好先使用遠端單位攻擊它，\n同時使用您的近戰單位來保護遠端單位，直到城市被佔領!

Luxury Resource = 奢侈資源
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 你的領土內的奢侈資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的奢侈資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n您擁有的每種獨一無二的奢侈資源都會給您的文明+5快樂，\n每種奢侈資源只能提供一份快樂加成，數量超過1的同種資源並不會提供更多的快樂，\n所以用它們和其他文明進行貿易吧!

Strategic Resource = 戰略資源
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 你的領土內的戰略資源需要建造相應的設施來開發，已開發的戰略資源可以用來與其他文明貿易。\n建造/訓練特定的項目(單位/建築)時將會消耗相應的戰略資源。如需要消耗1單位的馬來訓練1個騎手單位，\n沒有馬就不能訓練騎手。當該單位或建築被摧毀時，此資源將能再次使用。\n如果獲取資源途徑出現中斷，需要該資源的單位將受到戰鬥力減成，直至重新獲得該資源。
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 與奢侈資源不同，地圖上顯示的每個戰略資源圖示將提供多於1單位的該種資源。\n頂部資訊欄顯示了你擁有多少未使用的戰略資源。\n在概覽介面點擊“資源”按鈕可以查看你所擁有資源的完整資訊。

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 這座城市再也不能抵抗了!\n然而，要征服城市，請使用您的近戰單位佔領它。

After Conquering = 佔領城市的處理
When conquering a city, you can now choose to either  or raze, puppet, or annex the city.\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed. = 當征服了一座城市，您可以選擇摧毀、傀儡甚至吞併它。\n“摧毀城市”可以令城市人口每回合-1，人口為0時城市將完全被摧毀。
Puppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost, but its citizens will generate 1.5x the regular unhappiness.\nAnnexing the city will give you control over the production, but will increase the citizen's unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state! = “傀儡城市”意味著您將無法控制該城市的產能，\n好處是該城市將不會額外增加您研發科技和推行社會政策時的花費，同時該城市人口產生的不滿是正常值的1.5倍。\n“吞併城市”將會給予您該城市的絕對控制權，但該城市人口產生的不滿將是正常值的2倍。\n在城市內建造“法庭”可以使人口產生的不滿降低到正常值。\n可以在任何時候吞併已傀儡的城市，但已吞併的城市無法再變為傀儡狀態。選擇前請考慮清楚！

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 您遇到蠻族了！\n蠻族會不分青紅皂白地攻擊靠近它的每一個單位，\n所以請不要讓您的移民等平民單位靠近他們，同時還要注意你的斥候！

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 您遇到了另一個文明!\n其他文明一開始是和平的，您可以和他們進行貿易，\n但是他們以後可能會選擇對您宣戰。

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a scientific victory! = 當您完成了阿波羅計畫，可以開始在您的城市中建造飛船部件(需要相應科技)，\n來通過太空競賽贏得科技勝利！

Injured Units = 受傷單位
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive\nUnits heal 5 health per turn in enemy territory, 10 in neutral land,\n  15 inside your territory and 20 in your cities = 受傷的單位造成的傷害比未受傷時少，他們的生命值在不進行任何操作時可以回復。\n每回合生命值回復量取決於單位所處的位置：\n敵方領土時5點，中立領土時10點，己方領土時15點，城市中心地塊時20點。

Workers = 工人
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 工人對您所在城市的發展至關重要，因為只有他們才能在地塊上建造設施。\n設施可以提高地塊的產出，\n當市民在建有設施的地塊工作時，將給您的城市帶來更多的收益，同時城市也會發展得更快。

Siege Units = 攻城單位
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 攻城單位對城市具有極強的毀滅力，但在進攻前必須先把它架設起來。\n您的攻城單位架設起來後，它就可以從當前的地塊發起攻擊，\n但是一旦它移動到其他地塊，就需要重新架設。

Embarking = 陸軍單位的船運
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn.\nUnits are defenseless while embarked, so be careful! = 當研發了相應科技時，您的陸軍單位就會擁有船運能力，他們可以穿越海洋地塊！\n陸軍單位進入或離開水域後，當前回合內將不能再進行任何操作。\n陸軍單位處於船運狀態在海上行進時是沒有防禦能力的，所以請小心!

Idle Units = 空閒單位
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units = 如果當前回合不想對某個單位執行任何操作，可以點擊右上方“下個閒置單位”按鈕來跳過該單位。\n如果一段時間內不想對其執行任何操作，可以對該單位執行“駐守”或“休眠”指令，\n系統執行“回合結束前查看閒置單位”指令時將自動跳過處於“駐守”或“休眠”狀態的單位。\n如果想完全禁用“下個閒置單位”按鈕，請進入“設置”功能表並將“回合結束前查看閒置單位”設置為“否”。

Contact Me = 聯繫我吧！
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n UnCiv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 很好!當您已經熟悉了遊戲的全部內容，\n您會發現遊戲目前是不完整的，它還處於開發狀態。\n不過UnCiv將永遠是開源和免費的，\n這意味著您無須擔心廣告或付費問題。
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 您的支持將激勵著我進一步完善它，\n我一定會竭盡全力、精益求精。\n感謝玩家們的支持--您們是最棒的!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 如果喜歡它，請到Play Store對它進行評價。\n如果您發現了遊戲存在的問題或有什麼好的意見和建議，\n請聯繫我！\n我的email地址：yairm210@hotmail.com，\nGitHub專案頁面：https://github.com/yairm210/UnCiv。

Pillaging = 劫掠
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch. = 軍事單位可以劫掠地塊設施，“劫掠”可以回復單位25點生命值同時將設施化為廢墟。\n被“劫掠”的地塊仍舊可以工作，但從地塊設施獲得的效果——例如基本資源加成和戰略資源收益——將會消失。\n工人可以修復這些化為廢墟的設施，所花費時間將比重新建造它們要少。

Experience = 經驗
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 戰鬥中單位獲得的經驗可用於該單位的晉升。\n單位在近戰攻擊時獲得的經驗大於遠端攻擊時，在進攻時獲得的經驗大於防禦時。
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 單個單位與蠻族單位戰鬥時最多可獲得30經驗值-這意味著最多2次晉升。在那之後，該單位與蠻族單位戰鬥將不會獲得任何經驗。

Combat = 戰鬥
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 單位和城市都會因戰鬥而損傷，戰鬥受到許多不同因素的影響。\n每個單位都有一個特定的“基礎”戰鬥值用於戰鬥結算，該數值受遊戲難度設置、單位擁有的晉升技能、所處的位置等因素影響。
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 當近戰攻擊和防禦時，單位使用“戰鬥力”作為“基礎”戰鬥值。\n當進行遠端攻擊時，單位使用“遠端戰鬥力”作為“基礎”戰鬥值。
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 遠端攻擊可以在遠距離進行，這取決於單位的“攻擊範圍”。\n近戰攻擊時防禦者會對攻擊者造成反擊傷害，遠程攻擊則不會。

Research Agreements = 科研協定
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 在科研協定中，你和另一個文明將共同研究科技。\n在協定結束時，你和另一個文明都將“一次性”獲得大量的科研點數，這將用於你尚未研究的科技。
The amount of Science you receive at the end is dependent on the science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 科研協定的收益取決於協定期間科研產出總量較小的那個文明——因此，選擇簽訂科研協定物件時請慎重！

Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-states are nations that can't win, don't conquer other cities and can't be traded with. = 並不是所有文明都在和你爭奪勝利。城邦是無法勝利的文明，他們不能征服其他城市，也不能進行貿易。
Instead, diplomatic relations with city-states are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-state likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 相反，與城邦的外交關係取決於影響力——一個表示“城邦有多喜歡你”的數值。\n與他們的敵人戰鬥，解放他們的城市，或者給予他們一大筆金錢，都可以增加你對他們的影響力。
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 當影響力超過30時，根據城邦類型的不同您會獲得相應的獎勵。\n當影響力超過60，並且在所有文明中您對他們的影響力最高時，您將被他們視為“盟友”，可獲得更多的獎勵效果，同時還可以使用他們領土上的奢侈資源和戰略資源。

Great People = 偉人
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = 特定的建築和城市中的專業人員，每回合會產生偉人點數。\n不同類型的偉人，他們的點數積累分別獨立計算。\n每回合可獲得的偉人點數和已積累的偉人點數可以在概覽介面查看。
 # Requires translation!
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 偉人設施同時還有開發其所在地塊戰略資源的功能，所以請不必擔心偉人設施所在地塊的戰略資源開發問題！

Removing Terrain Features = 清除地貌
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to work those resources. = 某些地塊還擁有地貌——比如沖積平原或森林。其中一些地貌(如叢林、沼澤和森林)可以由工人清除。\n清除地貌不會移除地塊中的任何資源，相反的，有時只有這樣做才能開發這些資源。

Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 富士山、直布羅陀巨岩和大堡礁等自然奇觀，都是獨特的、無法通行的地貌，是大自然母親的傑作，具有不同於一般地形的非凡品質。\n開發它們會為你帶來大量的文化、科研、金錢或產能收益，這就是為什麼需要儘快將其納入你的帝國的原因。
