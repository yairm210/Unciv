The Muslim empire, the Caliphate was born in the turbulent years after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, as his followers sought to extend the rule of God to all of the people of the earth. The caliphate grew mighty indeed at the height of its power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia. An empire as great as or even greater than that of Rome. The arts and sciences flourished in Arabia during the Middle Ages, even as the countries of Europe descended into ignorance and chaos. The Caliphate survived for six hundred years, until finally succumbing to attack from the Mongols, those destroyers of Empires. =

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10,000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, however, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks who fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and through a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological superiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! =

Greetings and blessings be upon you, Kamehameha the Great, chosen by the heavens to unite your scattered peoples. Oh mighty King, you were the first to bring the Big Island of Hawai'i under one solitary rule in 1791 AD. This was followed by the merging of all the remaining islands under your standard in 1810. As the first King of Hawai'i, you standardized the legal and taxation systems and instituted the Mamalahoe Kawanai, an edict protecting civilians in times of war. You ensured the continued unification and sovereignty of the islands by your strong laws and deeds, even after your death in 1819. =

As the sovereign ruler of the Huns, you marched your army across Europe into Gaul, planning to extend your already impressive lands all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Your untimely death led to the quick disintegration and downfall of your empire, but your name and deeds have created an everlasting legacy for your people.  =

Fearsome General, your people call for the recreation of a new Hunnic Empire, one which will make the exploits and histories of the former seem like the faded dreaming of a dying sun.

Hail stalwart Prince William of Orange, liberator of the Netherlands and hero to the Dutch people. It was your courageous effort in the 1568 rebellion against Spanish dominion that led the Dutch to freedom, and ultimately resulted in the Eighty Years' War. Your undertaking allowed for the creation of one of Europe's first modern republics, the Seven United Provinces. You gave your life to the rebellion, falling at the hands of an assassin in 1584, but your death would only serve to embolden the people's charge, and your legacy as "Father of the Fatherland" will stand as a symbol of Dutch independence for all time. =

#################### Lines from Tutorials ####################

 # Requires translation!
Introduction = 
 # Requires translation!
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 

 # Requires translation!
New Game = 
 # Requires translation!
Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = 
 # Requires translation!
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to watch out for! = 
 # Requires translation!
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = 
 # Requires translation!
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = 

 # Requires translation!
In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention = 

 # Requires translation!
Culture and Policies = 
 # Requires translation!
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 
 # Requires translation!
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 
 # Requires translation!
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 

 # Requires translation!
City Expansion = 
 # Requires translation!
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 
 # Requires translation!
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 

 # Requires translation!
As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 
 # Requires translation!
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 
 # Requires translation!
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn’t do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 

 # Requires translation!
Unhappiness = 
 # Requires translation!
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, cities  will grow at 1/4 the speed, and your units will suffer a 2% penalty for each unhappiness = 
 # Requires translation!
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 
 # Requires translation!
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders = 

 # Requires translation!
You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 

 # Requires translation!
Roads and Railroads = 
 # Requires translation!
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 

 # Requires translation!
Victory Types = 
 # Requires translation!
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 
 # Requires translation!
There are three ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri = 
 # Requires translation!
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness,\n   and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 

 # Requires translation!
Enemy City = 
 # Requires translation!
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 

 # Requires translation!
Luxury Resource = 
 # Requires translation!
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 

 # Requires translation!
Strategic Resource = 
 # Requires translation!
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 

 # Requires translation!
The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 

 # Requires translation!
After Conquering = 
 # Requires translation!
When conquering a city, you can now choose to either  or raze, puppet, or annex the city.\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed. = 
 # Requires translation!
Puppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost, but its citizens will generate 1.5x the regular unhappiness.\nAnnexing the city will give you control over the production, but will increase the citizen's unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state! = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 

 # Requires translation!
Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a scientific victory! = 

 # Requires translation!
Injured Units = 
 # Requires translation!
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive\nUnits heal 5 health per turn in enemy territory, 10 in neutral land,\n  15 inside your territory and 20 in your cities = 

 # Requires translation!
Workers = 
 # Requires translation!
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = 

 # Requires translation!
Siege Units = 
 # Requires translation!
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 

 # Requires translation!
Embarking = 
 # Requires translation!
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn.\nUnits are defenseless while embarked, so be careful! = 

 # Requires translation!
Idle Units = 
 # Requires translation!
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units = 

 # Requires translation!
Contact Me = 
 # Requires translation!
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n UnCiv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 
 # Requires translation!
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 
 # Requires translation!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 

 # Requires translation!
Pillaging = 
 # Requires translation!
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch. = 

 # Requires translation!
Experience = 
 # Requires translation!
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 

 # Requires translation!
Combat = 
 # Requires translation!
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 

 # Requires translation!
Research Agreements = 
 # Requires translation!
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 
 # Requires translation!
The amount of Science you receive at the end is dependent on the science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 

 # Requires translation!
Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-states are nations that can't win, don't conquer other cities and can't be traded with. = 
 # Requires translation!
Instead, diplomatic relations with city-states are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-state likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 

 # Requires translation!
Great People = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 

 # Requires translation!
Removing Terrain Features = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to work those resources. = 

 # Requires translation!
Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 

 # Requires translation!
Keyboard = 
 # Requires translation!
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = 
 # Requires translation!
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: = 
 # Requires translation!
Space or 'N' - Next unit or turn\n'E' - Empire overview (last viewed page)\n'+', '-' - Zoom in / out\nHome - center on capital or open its city screen if already centered = 
 # Requires translation!
F1 - Open Civilopedia\nF2 - Empire overview Trades\nF3 - Empire overview Units\nF4 - Empire overview Diplomacy\nF5 - Social policies\nF6 - Technologies\nF7 - Empire overview Cities\nF8 - Victory Progress\nF9 - Empire overview Stats\nF10 - Empire overview Resources\nF11 - Quicksave\nF12 - Quickload = 
 # Requires translation!
