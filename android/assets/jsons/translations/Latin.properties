# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that
# may not turn into valid sentences. Therefore we have the following two translations to determine
# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

ConditionalsPlacement = after

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

May the gods bless you, great Nebuchadnezzar, ruler of ancient Babylon! Built 5000 years ago, Babylon emerged as an empire in 1800 BC, thanks to godlike Hammurabi, The Giver of Law. Falling under the Kassites assaults then the Assyrian domination, Babylon was reborn from its ashes, gaining back its independance, and became the beacon for Arts and Learning in the ancient world. O Nebuchadnezzar, after your death, Babylon quickly fell, conquered by the mighty Persians, and then by the Greeks, until the great city disappeared forever in 141 BC. = Dei beent te, Nabuchodonosor magne, rector antiquae Babyloniae! Aedificata quom quinque millibus annis aberat, Babylonia exstitit et facta erat imperium in MDCCC a.C.n., gratias Hammurabi divino, datori juris. Ruerat sub oppugnante de Kassitibus et postea dominatione Assyriâ, Babylonia erat renovata ex cinere suo, reparavit independentiam suam, et facta erat pharus ad artem et cognitionem in mundo antiquo. O Nabuchodonosor, postquam mortuus eras, Babylonia cito ruit, capta a Persicis et, postea, Graecis erat, donec urbs magna aeternaliter abiit in CXLI a.C.n.
Great Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon's glory still lives through you and your people. Will you create a spark to enlighten the world again? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? = Nabuchodonosor magne, gloria Babyloniae etiam vivit per te et tuum populum. Creabisne scintillam ut denuo illustres mundum?

Great King Alexander, leader of the mighty Greek nation, you are truly blessed by the gods. In 480 BC, quarrelsome city-states such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, found a way to join their forces, allowing Greece to defeat the mighty Persia in the 5th century BC, both on land and sea. Following their example, you lead a Greek coalition and finally struck down the Persian Empire in 331 BC. You conquered almost all the known world, and from Europe to Africa to India, you built an empire unmatched by any before it. = Rex magne Alexander, ductor populi Graeci potentis, vero es a deis fortunatus.

Secutus exemplar earum, duxisti coalitionem Graecam et tandem in CCCXXXI a.C.n. interfecisti Imperium Persicum.

Roman art and architecture have been praised for millenia and have been envied by all lesser civilizations who have followed. = Ave Caesar Auguste, Imperator Romae ac Domine Imperii Romani!

Potentia et honor derexerunt ad victorias gloriosas, ad dominationem terrarum ab Hispania in occidente ad Syriam in oriente, et accessit terras barbaras remotas Angliae et Germaniae.

Blessings of the Great God be upon you, O great caliph Harun al-Rashid, leader of the mighty Arabian people! The Muslim Empire, the Caliphate, born from chaos after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, intended to apply the rule of God to all Earth. And by the will of God, the caliphate reached its full power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia, to even surpass the Great Roman Empire. The arts and sciences were a holy gift of Arabia during the Middle Ages, as the infidel lands of Europe delved deep into ignorance and chaos. Lasting for six hundred years, the Caliphate finally fell before the Mongols, the plague of the civilized world. = Beatum Dei Magni fiat tibi, O magne calipha Aaron Rascide, ductor potentis populi Arabici! Imperium Musulmanum, Caliphatus, erat ortus ex congerie post mortem Mahometi in DCXXXII AD, intendebat applicare rectionem Dei ad omnem terram. Et per voluntatem Dei, caliphatus attingit omnem potentiam suam, regebat Hispaniam, Africam Septentrionalem, Orientem Medium, Anatoliam, Balcaniam et Persiam, et ad antecedendum Imperium Romanum magnum. Ars et scientia erant praemia sancta Arabiae intra medium aevum, cum terra infidelis Europae defodiebat in ignorantiam et congeriem. In sescentis annis permanserat, Caliphatus tandem ruit ante Mongalos, plagam mundi eruditi.

President Washington, we salute you and the proud American civilization! Freed from the British dominion in the 18th century, then cleansed and reborn after a terrible civil war, the United States nation was ready to play its great role in the 20th century. At the height of its power, triumphant after two terrible world wars, United States of America, a land of immigration, opportunities, optimism and determination, has risen above all other weakening nations, unable to equal such power. = Praesidens Washingtonie, nos salutamus te et civilizationem superbientem Americanam! In saeculo XVIII, a dominatione Britannicâ liberatus, et tum colatus et renatus post bellum terribile civile, populus Civitatum Foederatarum paraverat agere personam magnam suam in saeculo XX. In excelsitate potentiae suae, postquam triumphaverunt post duo bella mundi terribilia, Civitates Foederatae Americae, ac terra immigrationis, opportunitatis, optimismi et determinationis, surrexerunt super populos alios minutos omnes, qui non poterant cum ista potentia adaequare.

Bushido = 
Lord Oda Nobunaga, ruler of Japan, the land of the Rising Sun is at your command! Through history, Japanese people lived and died with honor, proud of their rich culture of arts and letters. Years of bloody civil wars, invasions of foreign powers, wealth but also great poverty, have never altered the strong will of the Rising Sun island, as the Bushido spirit has imbued the fields of battle and the Japanese society for millenia. At the end of the 19th century, under foreign influence, your people took the path of modernity, and in a few decades, made of Japan a land of technological innovation and powerful industry, with which only few nations can compete. = Domine, Oda Nobunaga, rector Iaponiae, terra solis orientis in tua dominatione est. Per historiam, Iapanici cum honore vivebant et moriebantur, superbientes ob culturam opimam suam de artibus et litteris erant. Anni de bellis civilibus cruentis, irruptiones de potestatibus alienis, divitiae et magna paupertas numquam mutaverunt voluntatem potentem insulae solis orientis, quia spiritus de Bushido est per millennia intinctus in campis bellorum et in societate Iaponica. In fine saeculi XIX, in influentia aliena, populus tuus ivit in viam ad modernitatem, et in decadibus fecit Iaponiam terram et innovationis technologiae et industriae potentis, ut pauci populi possent concertare.

Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you! India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land. Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty. For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders. In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place. In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority. After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history! =

O Great Sultan Suleiman, may the God bless you! You are revered for your power, wealth and generosity, and you truly deserves to be called the 'Magnificent'! The Ottoman Empire was born in Bithynia, starting as a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century, then expanded to west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your people vanquished the empire of Byzantium, annexing Turkey and the Balkans, and smartly assimilating all wonders and knowledge of the Byzantine civilization. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans added Constantinople to their empire, establishing a strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. The Empire would continue to expand for centuries reaching North Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height, but brutally disappeared in the chaos of the first world war, in early 20th century. = O magne Sultane Suleimane, Deus beet te! Ob tuam potentiam, divitiam lagitonemque reverendus es, et vero mereas 'Magnifico' vocari! Imperium Ottomanicum in Bithynia ortum erat, in saeculo XII incepit atque terra parva in Anatolia orientali, et tum ad occidentalem expandit in Anatoliam. Per saeculum posterius, populus tuus vicit Imperium Byzantinum, affixit Turciam et Balcaniam, et cate assimulavit miracula omnia et scientiam omnem civilizationis Byzantinae. In medio saeculi XV, Ottomanici addiderunt Constantinopolim imperio suo, condiderunt nexum strategematicum inter Europam et Orientem Medium. Imperium assidue in saeculis expanderet, in suo apice attigerit Africam, Orientem Medium et Eurogam Orientalem, sed brutaliter disparuit in congerie belli mundi primi, in principio saeculi XX.

Aloha to Kamehameha the Great, who the heavens allowed to unite your people! O great King, under your reign, the Big Island of Hawai'i became one in 1791 AD, and many other islands joined your vision of union in 1810. As the first King of Hawai'i, law and taxation systems were stabilized, and you promoted the Kanawai Mamalahoe, an edict to protect civilian people in times of war. Unification and sovereignty of all the islands continued thanks to your fair laws and deeds, even after you joined your ancestors in paradise in 1819. =

O Great King Ramkhamhaeng, the Siamese people obey you with respect and fear! The beautiful and mysterious land of Siam is an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia, which was besieged by many foes, plagued by bloody war and great poverty, but eventually the smart and loyal Siamese people have endured and triumphed. Siam was a part of the Khmer Empire until the 13th century AD, before its brave people took arms and led a revolution to form the small Sukhothai kingdom. After many battles and diplomacy prowess, this tiny kingdom became a mighty empire, which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century. =

Holy Isabella, envoy of God, Great Queen of Castille and León, your people celebrate you! Spain is a beautiful and ancient country, a link between Europe and Africa, one shore on the Mediterranean and the other on the mighty Atlantic Ocean. The Spanish culture had taken the best of the Christian and Muslim worlds, and was ready to dominate the world for centuries. Powerful Spanish military fleets and brave explorers found and conquered much of the New World. Exploiting a whole new continent and its riches, Spain reached a state of power few could compete with for hundreds of years. = Isabella sancta, nuntia Dei, Regina magna Castellae et Legionis, populus tuus celebrat te! Hispania est terra pulchra atque antiqua, est nexus inter Europam et Africam, uno litore ad Mare Mediterraneum et uno ad potentem Oceanum Atlanticum. Cultura Hispanica ceperat optimas mundorum Christiani et Musulmani, paraverat ad dominationem mundi saeculorum. Classes potentes Hispanicae et indagatores fortes invenerunt et vicerunt multum mundi novi. Usurpaverat novam continentem omnem et copiam illius, Hispania attigit statum potentiae, ut pauci possent in saeculis concertare.

Askia, leader of the Songhai people and greatest of all, may God watch your path towards glory!

Great King Sunni Ali Ber fought for independance, and showed to all Songhai's power, by conquering territories and repelling many foes who sought to destroy the rising kingdom. Ultimately, conquest of the wealthy cities of Timbuktu and Jenne made Songhai an empire with enough economic power to survive for a century, until the empire bowed down before foes with advanced technology - muskets against spearmen. =

O divine Montezuma, your people welcome you! May your magnificence inspire all living things! The mighty Aztecs were nomads until the 12th century, when they choose to settle in the mesa central, which would later be called Mexico. Wars were frequent with other tribes to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zampango. In some 200 years, double-sided alliances and martial prowess made of the Aztecs the dominant power in the Central American basin, forming a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea. Alas, the empire fell under the assault of foreign devils - the Spaniards and many curses they brought with them! Wars between tribes and weaponry of doom used by the invaders made the great Aztec civilization crumble in only a few decades. =

Great Attila, mighty warrior and leader of the Hunnic empire, your men bow down before you. During the 5th century, you and your brother Bleda have conquered many lands, forged a mighty empire and commanded the most powerful and frightening force of antiquity. You inspired fear to the Roman Emperors themselves, who called you 'Flagellum Dei', the 'Scourge of God', as you took kingdom after kingdom in the Balkans, invaded Eastern Roman Empire, into Gaul and Northern Italy, and planned to conquer Rome itself. Your empire didn't survive long after your death, but your name and your legend have, for millenia to come. = Attila magne, bellator potens ac ductor imperii Hunnisci, viri tui ante te flectunt. In quinto saeculo, tu et Bleda frater tuus vicistis terras multas, estis fabricati imperium potens et imperabatis classem potentissimam antiquitatis. Injecisti terrorem Imperatoribus Romanis ipsis, qui vocabant te 'Flagellum Dei', quia singillatim capiebas regna in Balcania, irrupisti Imperium Romanum Orientale, in Galliam et Italiam septentrionalem, et meditabaris vincere Romam ipsam. Imperium tuum non longinquo vixit post mortem tuam, sed tuum nomen et epos ita vivunt ad millennia.
Fearsome General, your mighty hordes are at your command, waiting to crush your foes once again and to conquer all the riches the world has to offer! Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? = Dux horrifice, copiae tuae potentes exspectant te imperare, manent denuo affligere hostes tuos et capere omnes divitias quas mundus offerat.

Greetings to the wise and brave Prince William of Orange, who freed the Netherlands and gave strength to the Dutch people. In 1568, you led a rebellion against Spanish dominion, to gain freedom for your people, and therefore starting the Eighty Years' War. Your actions were all aimed to create one of Europe's first modern republics, the Seven United Provinces. The rebellion was the meaning of your very life and death, as it was also the cause of your assassination in 1584. But your death has given even more pride and courage to your people, to fight for liberty against any oppressors. Carved in history as the 'Father of the Fatherland', your name is a symbol of Dutch independence for eternity. =

Noble and pious Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, the people revere your grace. After the death of your father King Charles VI, you inherited the throne of Austria during difficult economic and military times. But you used your wisdom and unflinching determination to fend off your foes and resolve any obstacles to stability and prosperity. With your husband Francis Stephen at your side as co-ruler, you assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reign, you reformed Austria in several domains, as you gifted it with a powerful army, a stable economic model, and an improved educational system. = Maria Theresia, Regina pia ac nobilis, Imperatrix Sacri Romani Imperii et majestatis Austriae, populus reveretur tuam gratiam.

Sed tuâ prudentiâ, destinatione interritâque usa es ad expugnationem hostium tuorum et solvisti obstacula cumque ad stabilitem prosperitemque. Cum Francisco Stephano, tuo marito ac pari rectore, tu confirmavisti statum tuum ut Imperatrix Sacri Romani Imperii eras. In dominatione tua, reformavisti Austriam de conspectibus nonnullis, ut donavisti ei legionem potentem, typum stabilem de oeconomia et systema melioratum de eruditione.

In the late 520's AD, you helped your husband engage in spiritual and legal reforms, promugalting numerous laws to improve women's status and treatment in the empire. You also made of Constantinople the jewel of the Eastern Roman Empire with the restoration and construction of many aqueducts, bridges, and churches, its beauty culminating with the creation of the Hagia Sophia, one of the most splendid pieces of architecture in the world. = Theodora, Imperatrix magna, amaris Byzantio et Roma.

In fine DXXX annorum Domini, maritum tuum ad reformationes spiritales et justa adjuvisti, jura ad meliorationem status et curationis feminarum in imperio promulgavisti.

Many legions fell under your fierce attacks and you burned the city of London with your anger.

 # Requires translation!
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = 

 # Requires translation!
Welcome to Unciv! = 
 # Requires translation!
Because this is a complex game, there are some tutorials to help familiarize you with it. These can be disbaled in the Options -> Display menu, but please hang on if you're new here! = 
 # Requires translation!
Your first mission is to found your capital city. This is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous. Many game bonuses apply only to your capital city, and it will be the center of your empire. = 
 # Requires translation!
How do you know a city location is appropriate? Luckily, the game has already chosen a good location for you. You can settle in this place, or maybe move a turn to found on a Hill (for Production and defence) or next to a Mountain (to gain access to the Observatory building later on). = 
 # Requires translation!
You'll likely want more cities later on. For these cities, you must go and find a good place. Looking for and founding on or near Luxury resources is a good rule of thumb. = 
 # Requires translation!
Luxury resources are tiles that have things like Gems, Cotton, or Silk (indicated by a yellow background of the resource icon). These resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as Iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to keep in mind! = 
 # Requires translation!
Cities will house Citizens, which can work tiles up to 3 tiles away from the city. This means you don’t have to settle cities right on or next to good tiles. Let’s say, for example, that you want access to some Iron – but the resource is in a desert area. You don’t have to settle your city in the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands. Your city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource. You only need to settle right on top of resources if you need them immediately. = 
 # Requires translation!
The first thing coming out of your city depends on the strategy you want to follow, but the 'classic' build order is to build first two Scouts, then a Shrine, and three Settlers, and adopt Tradition, to explore the map quickly (Scouts ignore terrain cost), and to get an early Pantheon (if you're playing with religion enabled). = 
 # Requires translation!
But feel free to experiment with your own build orders! = 

 # Requires translation!
In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 

Culture and Policies = Cultura et Dictata
 # Requires translation!
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 
 # Requires translation!
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = 
 # Requires translation!
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = 

City Expansion = Expansio Urbis
 # Requires translation!
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 
 # Requires translation!
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 

Food is the resource fundamental to your Cities', and as a result Nation's, population and health. = Cibus est merx fundamentalis de  multitudine et salute urbium tuarum et cur populi tui.
Every Citizen in each City consumes Food per turn. Any left over is considered Growth and is stored in the City Center. Once enough accumulates, the City Grows and a new Citizen is added. = Civis omnis in omni urbe omni gressu consumit cibum. Si qui reliquus est, videatur "auctus" et servetur in centro urbis. Quando satis accumulentur, urbs augeatur, et nova multitudo addatur.
Initially your main source of Food is the City Center itself and working a surrounding tile with a Citizen. You can increase how much is generated by gaining more Citizens to work more tiles, improving the tiles so that they yield more Food, and eventually Buildings and Policies. = Fons cibi tuus principalis in principio est centrum urbis ipsum, et cive operare tegulam de circumcurrentibus. Potes quantitatem adicere per acquisitionem civium plurium ad operandum plures tegulas, per meliorandum tegulas, quo producant plus cibi, et postremo, per aedificia et dictata.
Since a city's number of Citizens, or Population, determines how many tiles a City can work, Food is often the most important Resource. = Quoniam urbis numerus civium, sive multitudo, decernit tegulas quantas urbs potest operare, cibus cotidie est merx gravissima.

Production is the resource that lets a City Center build new things. = Fabricatio est materia qua centrum urbis aedificat res novas.
This can be new Buildings that are added to the City Center, or new Units that can go out across the World Map to advance your Nation's goals. = Hae fortasse sint aedificia, quae ad centrum urbis addantur, aut centuriae novae, quae possint ire per tabulam mundi, ad destinatum populi tui.
Everything you can build has a Production Cost. Every turn each City generates a certain amount of Production and puts it towards whatever is at the top of the Build Queue. Once the total cost is collected, the Building or Unit is built! = Id quod cumque aedificare potes, habet sumptum de fabricatione. In omni gressu urbes singulae generant aliquantum fabricationis et ponunt id ad illud quod cumque in capite agminis est. Quando sumptus totus colligitur, illud aedificium sive centuria, erit aedificatum!
Any excess Production after something is built is overflowed to the next thing the City builds. Up to it's total Production Cost. = Quaecumque sit fabricatio superflua postquam aliquod sit aedificatum, superfluitur ad rem secundam quam haec urbs aedificet, usque ad totum sumptum fabricationis ejus.
 # Requires translation!
Since this determines how quickly you can build more stuff, your Nation's Production Capacity is crucial to it's advancement and survival. = 

⍾Science is the resource that unlocks new and exciting Technologies for your Nation. = ⍾Scientia est materia quae pro populo tuo disserat technologias novas atque excitantes.
Once you've Founded your Capital, you'll be prompted to Pick a Technology to Research. = Postquam condis metropolim tuam, admonearis technologiam inveniendam eligere.
Every Technology costs an amount of ⍾Science. Every turn the ⍾Science your Nation produces is paid towards Researching your chosen Technology. = Technologia omnis sumit aliquantum ⍾scientiae. In omni gressu ⍾scientia, quam populus tuus producat, impenditur ad inveniendum technologiam a te electam.
Once a Technology has it's cost fully paid, you unlock the benefits for your Nation! This could be new Units, Buildings, or other advantages. Any surplus will overflow into the next Technology you pick to Research. = Quando unius technologiae sumptus totus impenditur, benefacta populo tuo disseras! Ea possint esse centuriam novam vel aedificium novum, vel aliqua alia bona. Si qua superflua est, superfluit in technologiam posteriorem quam elegeris ad cognitionem.
Researching a Technology in the next Era will advance you into that Era and trigger a notification to other Nations about how amazing you are! = Assectatio technologiae in posteriore aetate faciet te ingressum in eam aetatem et faciet aliis populis nutium de quanto mirus es!
Since new Technologies tend to give access to better Units, Buildings, and even unlock powerful new Policies, staying ahead of the competition is one of the best ways to secure your Victory! = Quoniam nova technologia cottidie dat aditum ad meliores centurias, aedificia et quoque disserat nova dictata potentia, prae certamen consistere est unum de modis optimis ad firmandum tuam victoriam!

Ah Gold. The Universal Medium of Exchange. Everyone loves Gold! They say it can't buy Happiness, but nuclear submarines are almost as good. = A, aurum. Medium universale commercii. Quisque amat aurum! Aliqui dixerunt eo emere felicitatem non posse, sed naves subaquaneae nucleares fere tam bonae sunt!
 # Requires translation!
You can earn more Gold from Tiles, Resources, Improvements, and eventually Buildings, Specialists, and Trade Routes. Ancient Ruins, meeting new City-States, and Pillaging are also great sources of Gold. During a Golden Age every Tile that already yields Gold will yield an additional Gold! = 
Gold is how you pay for Building Maintenance, Transportation Upkeep, and Unit Upkeep. If you run out of Gold, first you'll receive penalties to your ⍾Science production, then eventually your Units will start Disbanding as you can't pay their upkeep. = Solidi sunt ei quibus tu pendis ad tuitionem aedificiorum, tuitionem vecturae, et tuitionem centuriarum. Si solidi tibi desunt, primitus accipias poenas ad effectum ⍾scientiae tibi, et tandem centuriae tuae incipiant dimitti, quia non possis pendere ad tuitionem earum.
 # Requires translation!
Gold can be used to Buy Buildings and Units, helping bring up a new City or quickly build an Army. It can also buy Tiles to add to your City. It's also used to Upgrade your units from their older, obsolete forms to new, stronger versions. And investing it into a Research Agreement is a great way to convert it into ⍾Science. = 
 # Requires translation!
Gold is also very valuable in Diplomacy. You can directly Gift Gold to City-States to gain their favor. Use it to balance a Trade Deal with other Nations. Or demand every last drop after a successful war and your enemy sues for peace. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ironically, some may consider Gold to be one of the less important Resources. But it's flexible nature and importance to keep your Nation running makes it a precious thing to pay attention to. After all, everyone loves Gold. = 
 # Requires translation!
Not to be confused with the Resource of the same name, Gold Ore =

 # Requires translation!
As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 
 # Requires translation!
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 
 # Requires translation!
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 

Unhappiness = Ira
 # Requires translation!
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = 
 # Requires translation!
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 

 # Requires translation!
You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = 

Roads and Railroads = Viae et Viae Ferreae
Roads reduce the Movement Points required to move between two tiles connected by Roads. = Via minuit requirendos calculos de movendo ad motum trans duas tegulas concatenatas per vias.
Railroads improve this reduction even more! = Via ferrea jam majore meliorat hoc minuendum!
This greatly improves the speed you can get Units around the map. = Hoc multo meliorat celeritatem qua centurias circumvehentes tebulam habere possis.
Until you research the technology that removes it, Roads do not cross Rivers = Usque donec invenis technologiam quae emovet id, viae non trans fluvios transeunt.
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. = Urbes tuas per vias vel vias ferreas cum metropoli concatenare generet solidos per viam commercii.
However, since each Road and Railroad have a Maintenance Cost, it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow and only place where needed. = Autem, singulae viae et viae ferreae habent sumptum tuitionis, cur efficientius sit manere donec urbes augentur et modo ibi ponere ubi necessaria sit.

Trade Route = Via commercii
Connecting your cities to the capital by Roads and/or Railroads will generate Gold via the Trade Route. You earn more Gold the more Population the City and your Capital has. = Urbes tuas per vias vel vias ferreas cum metropoli concatenare generet solidos per viam commercii. Plus multitudinis tua urbs et metropolis habent, plures solidos mereas.
Note that each road costs 1 Gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 Gold, so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = Adnota singulas vias omni gressu sumere 1 solidum, et singulas vias sumere 2 solidos, cur efficientius sit manere donec urbes augentur!
Railroads connecting a city to the Capital also provide a 25% Production Boost to the City, but not the Capital. = Viae ferreae quae concatenant urbem cum metropoli etiam praebent urbi 25% additionem fabricationis, sed non metropoli.
Trade Routes are also connected over Water via certain buildings like the Harbor. As long as there is a chain that can reach the Capital, there's a Trade Route. Look for this symbol in Yellow below the City Name to mean you have an active Trade Route to your Capital. = Viae commercii etiam per aliqua aedificia portibus similia per aquam concatenatur. Via commercii ibi est, ubi catena potest metropolim attingere. Investiges symbolum flavum sub nomine urbis, quod indicat te habere actuosam viam commercii ad metropolim tuam.
Trade Routes can get broken either by Blockades or by Removing/Pillaging the connecting Road/Railroad chain. = Viae commercii possunt abrumpi per obsidionem vel per summovendum, aut diripiendum, catenam viarum aut viarum ferrearum.

 # Requires translation!
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 
 # Requires translation!
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 
 # Requires translation!
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 

Enemy City = Urbs hostilis
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = Urbes possunt capi per minuendum salutem earum ad 1 et imperandum centuriam propinquitatis ingredi in urbem.\nQuoniam urbes omni gressu medentur, optime est quod centuriae longinquitatis oppugnent cum centuriae propinquitatis defendant eas donec urbs sit victa!

Luxury Resource = Merx Luxuria
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = Merces luxuriae cum meliorationibus specialibus suis intra fines tuos sunt concatenatae in tuum reticulum commerciale.\nMerx unica tua omnis dat 5 felicitatem civilizationi tuae, sed merces addititiae generis aequi dat nullam, sic eis utaris ad commercium cum aliis civilizationibus!

Strategic Resource = Merx Strategematica
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = Merces strategematicae cum meliorationibus specialibus suis intra fines tuos sunt concatenatae in tuum reticulum commerciale.\nMerces strategematicae habilitant te educare centurias, quae requirant has merces speciales, et aedificare aedificia, quae requirant eas, e. g., caballarius requirat equos.
 # Requires translation!
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 

 # Requires translation!
The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = 

After Conquering = Post Captum
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = Quando urbem capias, possis eligere sic urbem liberes aut affigas aut exscindas aut municipium facias.
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = \nUrbem liberare reddat eam eae possessori, det tibi additionem diplomaticam magnam cum eo!\n\nUrbem affigere det tibi omne imperium eae, sed etiam duplicet iram civium!\nHoc potest mitigari per aedificandum jus in urbe, quo ira civium reficiatur cottidiana.\n\nUrbem municipium facere indicet te sine imperio esse de productio de urbe.\nIsta urbs non augeat sumptum tuum technologiae vel dictati.\nMunicipium potest aliquando affigi, sed urbs affixa non potest refici municipium!\n\nUrbem exscindere omni gressu faciat eae multitudinem uno minorem donec exscissa sit!\nNon potes exscindere urbem quae est metropolis initialis alicujus civilizationis aut urbs sancta alicujus religionis.

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = Centuriam barbaram oppetivisti!\nBarbari indiscrete appugnant aliquem omnem,\nsic non permittas centuriis paganis tuis prope eos ire,\net cures exploratores tuos!

You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = Civilizationem aliam oppetivisti!\nCivilizationes aliae pacate incipiunt, et potes cum eis mercari,\n sed fortasse posteriore eligant bellum contra te indicere.

Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = Postquam perfeceris Programma Apollinem, possis incipere partes astronavis in urbibus tuis\n (per technologiam pertinentem) construere, ut victoriam scientificam feras!

Injured Units = Centuriae Plagatae
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = Centuriae plagatae dant minus damnum, sed medentur post gressûs quibus non agant.\nCenturiae medentur contra 10 damnum gressu quo cumque sit in terra hostili vel neutrali,\n  20 in terra tua et 25 in urbibus tuis.

Workers = Opifices
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = Opfices sunt graves pro auctu urbis tuae, quia nonnisi ei possunt meliorationem in tegulis construere.\nMeliorationes augent productum de tegulis tuis, habilitant urbem tuam plures producere et celeriter augeri cum operentur tegulas quarum numerus aequus sit!

Siege Units = Centuriae Machinarum Bellicarum
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = Centuriae machinarum bellicarum adprime sunt potentes contra urbes, sed eis necesse est statui ut possint oppugnare.\nStatim quam centuria tua machinae bellicae statuta sit, ab hac tegula appugnare possit, sed quam in tegulam aliam mota sit, denuo statui necesse sit.

Embarking = Conscensio
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = Postquam technologia certa sit inventa, centuriae tuae possint conscendere, sic habilitent eas trans tegulas aquae ire.\nAquam ingredi aut aqua egredi sumat gressum omnem.
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = Centuriae sine defensione sint quom in navibus sint (non possit mutari), et habeant potentiam certam de defensione de aetate tua technologiarum, sic evigiles.\nCenturiae longinquitatis non possint appugnare. Centuriae propinquitatis cum poena de potentia sint. Etiam habeant visionem finitam.

Idle Units = Centuriae Otiosae
 # Requires translation!

Pillaging = Direptio
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = Centuriae militares possunt meliorationes diripere, quo eae medeantur contra 25 damnum, et melioratio ruat.\nTegula etiam possit operari, sed bona de melioratione - statisticae addititiae et merces - amittantur.\nOpfices possunt has meliorationes reparare, quod sumat tempus pauciorius quam meliorationem a nihilo aedificare.\nDiripere aliquas meliorationes faciat quod centuriae tuae a melioratione auferant solidos.

Experience = Experientia
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = Centuriae quae ingredintur proelium acquirunt experientiam, quae deinde potest sumi ad promotionem illius centuriae.\nCenturiae acquirunt plus experientiae ob proelium propinquum quam longinquum et plus ob oppugnationem quam defensionem.
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = Centuriae non possunt plus experientiae quam 30 ob barbaros acquirere, id est, non plures quam 2 promotiones. Postea, barbari praebeant nullam experientiam.

Combat = Proelium
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = Centuriae et urbes interficuntur proelio, quod aliquantis variis aestimationibus afficitur.\nCenturia omnis habet aestimationem 'fundamentalem' certam proelii, quae potest aliqualibus condicionibus, promotionibus et locis meliorari.
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = Cum faciunt propinquitatis oppugnationem et defensionem, centuriae utuntur aestimatione 'potentiae,' quae tum fiat aestimatio fundamentalis proelii.\nCum faciunt oppugnationem longinquitatis, utantur 'potentiâ oppugnationis longinquæ.'
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = Oppugnationes longinquitatis possunt ex longinquo fieri, dependent de aestimatione 'ambitûs.'\nCum oppugnationes propinquitatis permittunt defensori retaliando damnare oppugnatorem, oppugnationes longinquitatis non permittunt.

Embassies = 
 # Requires translation!
Establishing an embassy in other players' Capital city shows the location of their Capital, likewise other players who establish an embassy in your Capital can see location of your Capital. = 
 # Requires translation!
Embassies thus allow Spies to be placed in another players' Capital City if Espionage is enabled. = 
 # Requires translation!
Mutual embassies are required to allow trading open borders and to sign Research Agreement and Defensive Pact. = 
 # Requires translation!
Declaring war on another player or denouncing them will remove embassies from both players' Capitals. You will have to re-establish them to use their effect. = 
 # Requires translation!
Re-establishing an embasy after denounciation from either side becomes available next turn, while re-establishing them when at war requires peacy treaty. = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when accepting embassy from other players because they can spy on your capital, or worse may start planning to attack you. = 
 # Requires translation!
Embassies are available using the Gods and Kings ruleset. = 

 # Requires translation!
Open Borders from other player and vice versa allow units to freely pass trough their territoy. = 
 # Requires translation!
They also let Missionaries to enter other players' territory without suffering attrition. = 
 # Requires translation!
Open Borders expire depending on game speed and are canceled upon Declaration of War, the closure however takes effect only after war ends and need to be traded again. = 
 # Requires translation!
You gain diplomatic boost with other AI player if you both have Open Borders to each other = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when giving Open Borders because other player may settle a City near your lands in an area you are planning to use, they may also use your territory to attack your friends or City State allies. = 
 # Requires translation!
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Open Borders can be traded. = 
 # Requires translation!

Research Agreements = Concordiae de Scientia
 # Requires translation!
In Research Agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of ⍾Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 
 # Requires translation!
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 
 # Requires translation!
Note that before you can invest in a research agreement, you must have a Declaraction of Friendship, both Nations need the required Technology, and both Nations need enough Gold on hand for the agreement. = 
 # Requires translation!
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Research Agreement can be signed. = 

Defensive Pacts = Foedera de Defensione
 # Requires translation!
Defensive pacts allow you and another civ to protect one another from aggressors.\nOnce the defensive pact is signed, you will be drawn into their future defensive wars, just as they will be drawn into your future defensive wars. Declaring war on any Civ will remove all of your defensive pacts. You will have to re-sign them to use their effect. = 
 # Requires translation!
Be cautious when signing defensive pacts because they can bring you into wars that you might not want to be in. = 
 # Requires translation!
The AI is very careful and will not accept defensive pacts with less than 80 influence. = 
 # Requires translation!
When playing with the Gods and Kings ruleset mutual embassies need to be established before Defensive Pact can be signed. = 

Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, can't be traded with, and instead confer certain bonuses to friendly civilizations. = Ne omnes populi cum te pro victoria contendunt.\nCivitates urbium sunt populi qui non possunt ferre victoriam nec possunt commercari sed magis donant amicis praemia aliqualia.
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = Propinquitates diplomaticae cum civitatibus urbium magis cernuntur per influentiam - metrum de quantitate qua civitates urbium amant te.\nInfluentia potest adici per oppugnandum hostes eorum, liberandum urbis eorum, et dandum eis aliquantum solidorum.
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = Aliqualia praemia dentur quom sis super 30 influentiam.\nQuom habeas influentiam super 60 atque maximam cum eis, in civilizationibus omnibus, videaris socius eorum, et mereas ampliora praemia et accessionem mercium luxuriarum, et mercium strategematicae, in terris eorum.

While working the land is good, eventually your Citizens will want to Specialize. = Cum operari agrum est bonum, cives tui tandem volent fieri specialistae.
Certain Buildings will also provide Specialist Slots. These slots will show up in the Citizen Management within the City Screen under Specialists. Each slot can be filled with a Citizen which will then become a Specialist. = Aliquanta aedificia etiam praebent spatia specialistarum. Haec spatia appeant sub "specialistis" in  "administratione civium" in "ostentu urbis." Spatium omne potest impleri cive, qui tum fiat specialista.
Each Specialist will generate a certain amount of yield as indicated to the right of the available slots. = Specialista omnis generet tantum producti, quantum indicatur in loco dextro spatiorum parabilium.
While these are a great way to specialize the yield production of a City outside of the surrounding Tile Yields, Specialists have an additional value. Each one also generates Great Person Points each turn. With enough of them, a new Great Person will join your Nation. = Cum haec sunt modus bonus quo productum urbis fiat speciale extra producta tegularum circumcurrentium, specialistae habent aestimationem addititiam. Omnis etiam omni gressu generat calculos personarum magnarum. Satis cum eis, nova persona magna cum populo tuo coeat.
See also Great People = Et videas Personas Magnas

Great People = Personæ Magnæ
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = Aliquanta aedificia, et specialistae in urbibus, omni gressu generant calculos personarum magnarum.\nAliquanta sunt genera personarum magnarum, et calculi earum seorsum accumulantur.\nNumerus calculorum omnis gressûs et calculi accumulati possunt in ostentu breviarii videri.
 # Requires translation!
Alternatively, the Great Person points breakdown per city can be viewed in each City Screen (see UI Tips article). = 
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = Quando satis calculi sint accumulati, persona magna ejus generis creetur!\nPersona magna omnis potest construere aliqualem meliorationem magnam, quae paulatim det productum magnum, aut nunc confestim sumi ad praebendum praemium aliquale.
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = Meliorationes magnae etiam praebent mercem strategematicam quae cumque subest eis, sic tibi necesse non est sollicitari, num merces sub meliorationibus tuis patefaciantur!
See also Specialists = Et videas Specialistas

Removing Terrain Features = Summovere Adjuncta Humorum
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = Aliquantae tegulae habent adjuncta humorum - similia sunt campis alluvialibus vel silvis - super se. Aliquantum horum coriorum, e.g. silva tropica, palus et silva, possunt ab opificibus summovere.\nSummovere adjunctum humi non summoveat mercem quae cumque in ea tegula est, et vulgo requiritur ad addendum meliorationes quo hae merces usurpentur.

 # Requires translation!
Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, ⍾Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 

Keyboard = Plectrologium
 # Requires translation!
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = 
 # Requires translation!
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: = 
 # Requires translation!
Space or 'N' - Next unit or turn\n'E' - Empire overview (last viewed page)\n'+', '-' - Zoom in / out\nHome - center on capital or open its City Screen if already centered =

 # Requires translation!
When at later stages of the game, you might have a lot of units but only a little to do. To help you we have implemented an AutoPlay feature that lets you use the AI to play part or all of your turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
To enable AutoPlay, go to options and open the AutoPlay tab and press "Show AutoPlay button". = 
 # Requires translation!
Clicking on the AutoPlay button opens a popup menue for choosing to AutoPlay parts or all of your turn. = 
 # Requires translation!

 # Requires translation!
Multi-turn AutoPlay is not advised on harder difficulty levels as your AI will not play better against an AI with modifiers. = 
 # Requires translation!
Multi-turn AutoPlay for multiplayer is not yet supported. = 

After building a shrine, your civilization will start generating ☮Faith. = Postquam aedem aedificas, civilizatio tua incipiet generare ☮fidem.
When enough ☮Faith has been generated, you will be able to found a pantheon. = Quando ☮fides satis generata sit, possis Pantheum fundare.
A pantheon will provide a small bonus for your civilization that will apply to all cities that have it as a majority religion. = Pantheum praebeat civilizationi tuae praemium parvum, quod applicetur omnibus urbibus quibus illud est religio majoritatis.
Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = Nec ulla civilizatio potest opiniones Panthei plures quam unam eligere, nec ulla opinio Panthei potest aliquotiens pluribus quam semel eligi.
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = Generare ☮fidem majorem habilitet te fundare religionem.

Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = Adsidue generes ☮fidem, ut tandem propheta magnus in una de urbibus tuis oriatur.
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = Hæc propheta magnus possit ad nonnullas adhiberi: ad constructionem sitûs sancti, ad fundationem religionis et ad stratum religionis tuae.
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = Quando fundas religionem, potes duas opiniones alias eligere. Opinio institutoris modo applicetur vobis, autem opinio assectatorum applicetur omnibus urbibus quae sequuntur religionem tuam.
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = Et urbs, qua (con-)sumas prophetam magnum tuam, fiat urbs sancta illius religionis.
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = Postquam fundas religionem, prophetae magni nonnumquam oriantur, sed fides☮, quantam necesse est tibi retinere, sit major.
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = Unus de his prophetis magnis tum possit religionem tuam amplificare.
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = Hoc permittat tibi eligere aliam opinionem assectatorum, et opinionem amplificatoris, quae modo applicetur tibi.
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = Cures ut celeriter fundes religionem. Tantum ferme dimidii lusores in ludo possint religionem fundare!

Beliefs = Opiniones
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = Quattuor sunt genera opinionum: opiniones Panthei, institutorum, assectatorum et amplificatorum.
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = Opiniones Panthei et assectatorum applicentur singulis urbibus quae sequantur, cum opiniones institutorum et amplificatorum modo applicentur institutori religionis.

Religion inside cities = Religio intra urbes
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = Cum urbs conditur, ea non statim sequetur unam religionem.
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = Religio quam urbs sequitur dependet de toto impulsu quem omnis religio in urbe habet.
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the City Screen. = Assectatores disponuntur in proportionibus aequis cum his impulsibus, et hi assectatores possunt in ostentu urbis videri.
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = Tibi licet per eligedum urbes quas non possides cernere assectatores et impulsûs religiosos in eis.
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = In ambobus locis, attingere symbolum religionis ostendat indicia concisa de effectibus ejus.
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = Per hoc fundamentum, possis sentire eas quae religiones in urbe habent impulsum magnum aedificatum, et eas quae fere habent nullum.
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = Urbs sequitur unam religionem si majoritas multitudinis sequitur eam, et solummodo tum accipiet effectûs opinionum assectatorum et Panthei illius religionis.

Spreading Religion = Religionem Sternere
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = Religionem sternere naturaliter evenit, sed potest properari per usum missionarii vel prophetae magni.
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = Missionarii possunt emi in urbe quae sequitur religionem pleram, et asciscet religionem illius urbis.
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = Sic cures locum ubi emis eos! Si qua alia civilizatio convertit unam de urbibus tuis ad religionem eorum, missionarius ibi emptus sequitur religionem eorum.
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = Propheta magnus semper habet religionem tuam quom is apparet, etsi emitur in urbibus quae sequuntur religiones alias, sed prophetae magni capti vero retinent suam religionem originalem.
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = Utrique prophetarum magnorum et missionariorum possunt sternere religionem ad urbes quom sunt intra fines earum etsi urbium civilizationum aliarum.
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = Hae duae centuriae etiam possunt ingredi tegulas civilizationum, cum quibus non habes concordiam de apertione finium!
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = Sed cures, missionarii amittant 250 potentiam religiosam gressu quo cumque in terris alienis sunt quom gressus perficitur.
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = Hoc minuat efficaciam eorum quom sternunt religionem. Si potentia religiosa eorum quando attingit 0, amiserint fidem suam et disparebunt.
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = Quando sternis religionem tuam, potentia religiosa centuriae addatur ut fiat impulsus pro ista religione.
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = Urbes quoque passive addunt urbibus propinquis impulsum suae religionis majoritatis.
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = Omnis urbs omni gressu praebet +6 impulsum omnibus urbibus quae non pluribus quam 10 tegulis absunt, sed exacta quantitas impulsûs dependet de celeritate ludi.
This pressure can also be seen in the City Screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = Hic impulsus quoque potest in ostentu urbis videri, et det tibi imaginem de religionibus, quantae in tua urbe volvent si non agis quid.
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = Urbes sanctae etiam praebent sibi +30 impulsum de religione ibi fundatâ, faciunt admodum difficile conversu urbis sanctae.
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = Postremo, antequam fundas religionem, urbes a te conditae cum 200 impulsu pro Pantheo tuo incipient.
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = Sic, omnes urbes tuae incipient sequi Pantheum tuum quamdiu non fundavisti religionem.

Inquisitors = Inquisitores
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = Inquisitores sunt centuriae religiosae postremae, et sua potentia est alias religiones emovere.
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = Ei possunt emovere alias religiones omnes ex una de urbibus tuis, emoveant impulsum qui cumque aedificatus est.
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = Prophetae magni quoque habent hanc facultatem, et emovent alias religiones omnes ex urbe cum sternunt suam religionem.
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = Hoc frequenter facit urbem statim conversam ad religionem eorum.
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is unaffected. = Praeterea, quom inquisitor positus in sive immediato ad urbem est, centuriae religionum aliarum non possunt ibi sternere fidem suam, quamquam sternere naturale non est affectum.

The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = Facultas unica Mayensis, 'Numeratio Longinqua', est cum effectu secundo:
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = Quando vegeta sit, ostentus anni ludi utatur notis Mayensibus.
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = Mayenses metiebantur tempus in diebus ab eo quem vocemus undecimum Augusti, 3114 a.C.n. Dies vocatur K'in; 20 dies sunt 1 Winal; 18 Winal sunt 1 Tun; 20 Tun sunt 1 B'ak'tun; 20 B'ak'tun sunt 1 Piktun, et cetera.
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = Unciv modo ostendit ය B'ak'tun, ඹ K'atun et ම Tun (a laeva ad dextram), quia satis sunt ad approximandum annos Calendarii Gregoriani. Notae numerorum Mayenses sunt bene manifestae ad intellegendum. Beeris cum interpreteris eas!

Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = Urbes tuae periodo poscent merces luxurias varias ut satisfaciant suum desiderium rerum novarum.
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = Si tibi mercando, expandendo aut vincendo succedit luxuriam quæsitam acquirere, urbs celebrabit Festum de Amore Regis Nostri in 20 gressibus sequentibus.
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = In Festo de Amore Regis Nostri, urbs 25% addititiâ celeritate augeatur.
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = Hoc indicat explorationem et mercatum esse graves ad auctum tuarum urbium!

Air Combat and Interception = Proelium Aerium et Interceptio Aeria
Air Combat is very similar to normal Combat, with a few wrinkles. Damage is still dealt using the same equations based on the relative Strength of the Attacking and Defending Unit. = Proelium aërium est maxime simile proelio cotidiano cum nonnullis differentiis. Damnum etiam detur per aequationem aequam cujus fundamentum sit potentia comparativa centuriae appugnantis et defendentis.
However, before the Attacker and Defender fight, there is an added combat phase called Interception. If there is any unit with Interception Range that covers the target attacked tile, then it will attempt to Intercept the Attacking Air Unit. If multiple units can Intercept, the one with higher Intercept chance does it. = Autem, antequam oppugnator et defensor pugnent, spatium, dicitur interceptio, intra proelium addatur. Si qua centuria est cum ambitu interceptionis, intra quem est tegula intenta appugnanda, ea tentet intercipere centuriam aëriam appugnantem. Si centuriae plurales possunt intercipere, ibi quae cum probabilitate majore faciat, faciet.
Generally Land/Naval Units have an Intercept Range of 2 Tiles, and Air Units have an Intercept Range of their Attack Range. = Centuriae marinae/terrae generaliter habent ambitum interceptionis qui est 2 tegulae, et aëriae habent ambitûs interceptionis aequos ambituum oppugnationis suorum.
Ground and Naval Units don't require movement points to Intercept, just Attacks. Air Units cannot have moved nor attacked in the preceding turn. = Centuriae marinae et terrae non requirant calculos de movendo ad interceptionem, sed ad oppugnationem. Centuriae aëriae nec appugnare nec moveri potuerint in gressu priore.
The Intercepting Unit rolls to see if it hits. Whether it hits or not costs an Attack, and most units (without Promotions) can only Attack Once per Nation's Turn. It does NOT cost Movement Points, but Air Units that have used their Movement cannot Intercept between turns. = Centuria intercipiens volvat, ut contactusne cernatur. Sive contingat sive non contingat, una oppugnatio consumatur, et plurimae centuriae (sine promotione) modo possunt in omni gressu omnis populi semel appugnare. Ea NON sumat calculos de movendo, sed centuriae aëriae, quarum momentum sit in gressu priore sumptum, non possint inter gressûs intercipere.
If the Intercepting Unit Hits, it deals damage according to the Combat Strength calculation to the Attacking Air Unit, potentially with any Strength Bonuses that apply to Interception. It does not receive damage from the Attacking Air Unit. = Si centuria intercipiens contingit, dat centuriae aëriae appugnanti damnum ob calculum potentiae de proelio cum praemio potentiae quod cumque applicetur interceptioni. Ea non accipiet damnum de centuria aëria appugnante.
After Interception resolves, the Attacking Air Unit and the Defending Unit in the targeted tile do Combat as normal, with damage dealt to both sides. = Postquam interceptio sit certa, centuria aëria appugnans et centuria defendens in tegula intenta faciant proelium acsi cotidianum sit, ut damnum duabus detur.
To help deal with Interceptions, see Air Sweeps. = Ut adjuveris contra interceptiones, Aëra Verrere videas.

Air Sweeps = Aëra Verrere
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = Centuriae quae sunt aëroplana pugnantia possunt aëra super tegulam verrere, adjuvent emovere interceptiones quae fortasse possint illam tegulam contingere sive a terra aut aqua, sive de aëre.
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = Cum haec actio sumat unam oppugnationem, emolumentum sit quod exceptio interceptionis adjuvet defendere tuas alias centurias, in primis, bomboplana.
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = Centuria tua semper adducat unam interceptionem si qua potest tegulam intentam contingere, etsi centuria intercipiens cum probabilitate ad defectum sit.
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = Si Interceptor non est centuria aëria (e.g. sive marina sive terrae), Interceptor et centuria, quae verrit aëra, accipiunt nullum damnum!
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = Si Interceptor est centuria aëria, duae centuriae sine praemio interceptionis dabunt damnum utri in pugna directa. Et nonnisi centuria, quae verrit aëra, accipiat ullum praemium potentiae de verrendo aëra.

Fortify, Guard, Withdraw = Fortificare, Custodire et Abscedere
Most Land units have the ability to Fortify. As they spend time without moving, they will slowly gain a Fortification Bonus to their Combat Strength representing digging in and preparing in case of an attack. = Centuriae plurimae terrae habent facultatem ad fortificandum. Quando sumunt tempus ne moveant, lente mereant praemium fortificationis suae potentiae proelii, quod repraesentat defodiendum et parandum contra oppugnationem.
Some units have the ability to Withdraw before a melee attack is struck. However, perhaps you wish for them to stand their ground to protect a particular tile. If you do, then give them the Guard command and they will stay fixed until they die or you give them fresh orders. = Aliquantae centuriae habent facultatem ad abscedendum antequam una oppugnatio propinquitatis attingit. Sed fortasse velis eas sistere in sua humo ut progetant unam tegulam certam. Si ita vis, des eis jussionem custodiae, et tum manebunt ut fixae fiant donec mortuae sint sive des eis jussionem novam.
This is NOT the same as Fortify but they will still gain the Fortification Bonus. They will simply not utilize their Withdraw ability. Fortified units with the Withdraw ability will try to flee when attacked. = Hoc NON est aequum quam fortificare sed eae etiam mereant praemium fortificationis. Eae simpliciter non utantur facultate suâ ad abscedendum. Centuriae fortificantes cum facultate abscessionis tentent abscedere cum appugnantur.

City Tile Blockade = Obsidio Tegularum Urbis
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = Una de tegulis tuis obsidetur hoste: quom centuria hostilis sistit in tegula a te possessa, ea tegula non producat res et non possit urbe operari in hoc gressu. Urbs per automataria denuo assignet multitudinem a tegula quae obsidetur.
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = Centuriae militares hostiles terrae obsident tegulas quibus sistunt. Centuriae marinae militares hostiles additis obsident tegulas adjacentes aquae. Ut protegas tegulas tuas ab obsidione, ponas centuriam amicam militarem in illam vel expellas incurrentes.

City Blockade = Obsidio Urbis
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = Una de urbibus tuis est in marina obsidione! Quom omnes adjacentes tegulae aquae urbis littoralis obsidentur, urbs amittat catenationem portus cum urbibus aliis et metropoli. Cures emovere obsidionem per ponendum centurias marinas militares amicas ad expellendum incurrentes.

Spies! = Curiosi!
The first time a civ reaches the Renaissance era each nation gets one spy. Every time a civ reaches an era afterwards they get one more spy. = Quando primitus aliqua civilizatio attingit aetatem renascentiae, populus omnis mereat unum emissarium. Quandocumque aliqua civilizatio attingit aetatem post eam, omnis pluribus mereat emissarium.
 # Requires translation!
Spies can be sent out to foreign cities to steal technology, rigging elections or stage coups. Place them in your own cities to do counter-intelligence work. = 
 # Requires translation!
Only one spy per civ is allowed in each city. Spies that are not in any city are on vacation in your spy hideout. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies set up in cities of major civilizations will try to steal technology at a rate which is based off of the science production in the city. Succeeding to steal technology will level up your spy. Failing to succeed will level up the defending spy if it is present. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies set in city-states will try to rig the elections in order to gain influence and reduce the influence of other civilizations. Only one spy partaking in rigging the election can win. = 
 # Requires translation!
A spy that is rigging an election in a city-state may also stage a coup. The likelihood of success for the coup depends on your relative influence to the current ally of the city-state, your spy level, and the level of the spy that the current ally has in the city-state if present. Succeeding a coup will make you their new ally and reduce the influence of all other civs. Failing a coup will kill your spy and level up the defending spy if present. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies that are set up in your own cities will be conducting counter-intelligence. They reduce the success chance of other spies trying to steal your technology. = 
 # Requires translation!
Spies at a higher rank have a higher chance of success. The max rank a spy can reach is rank 3. After a spy is killed it will revive after a certain amount of turns back at rank 1. = 
 # Requires translation!
Building buildings like the constabulary and police station will reduce the technology steal rate of spies in that city. =

Differences from Civilization V = 
 # Requires translation!
Production Focus\nIn Civilization V, the Food yield in a city is calculated first, then population grows by consuming stored food (growth), then production is calculated, and so on one by one the other stats are calculated. Thus, citizens can produce yields in the same turn as they are born. The city focus is set to Production to assign the newborn citizen to a hill so they'll contribute Production, and then manually reassigned to a growth tile on the next turn. Alternatively, you can set city focus to Gold (e.g. with Cerro de Potosi), Faith (e.g. with Mount Sinai) or whatever gains the most yields. In Unciv, citizens only start producing yields on the next turn, so you can ignore this whole concept. = 
 # Requires translation!
Science Queueing\nIn Civilization V, Science yield is calculated after production, so if you finish an item and have Science (or Gold) queued as a perpetual construction, the Production overflow from item will be converted into Science (or Gold), but the Production is not consumed, as this will only happen again on the next turn. By immediately swapping out your perpetual construction for an item on the next turn, you'll get this Science (or Gold) for free. This doesn't apply to Unciv, so don't bother. = 
 # Requires translation!
Double Aqueducts\nIn Civilization V, the game sells existing copies of the building for you before providing a free copy of the building. So, if you build an aqueduct in a city, and then in the turn of adopting Tradition Complete you sell a cheap building (e.g a shrine) beforehand, the game is unable to sell more than 1 building per turn, and thus you'll keep your aqueduct, together with the new free aqueduct. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Legalism Oxford\nIn Civilization V, national wonders such as Oxford University are considered culture buildings, so you can get them for free with Legalism. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Roads and Forts\nIn Civilization V, you can't use roads and forts in enemy territory. In Unciv, you can use them, so instead of mindlessly constructing them everywhere when at war, you need to decide if and when they'll benefit you more than your opponents. = 
 # Requires translation!
Citizen Conversion\nIn Civilization V, a citizen is born religious if the parent city is already converted. This is not the case in Unciv, which can lead to temporary deconversion of a city when it grows. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unassigned Citizens\nIn Civilization V, unassigned citizens are considered specialists, and subject to the same type of bonuses (e.g. Korea's ability). It can be worthwhile to leave citizens unassigned, instead of being assigned to a tile. Not applicable to Unciv. = 
 # Requires translation!
Settler Construction\nIn Civilization V, cities can't starve when constructing settlers, so you can assign all citizens to production tiles and none to food tiles. In Unciv, citizens keep consuming two food per turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Water Melee Attack\nAs result of a Discord poll, Water Melee units can attack military land units on the shore, unlike in Civilization V. = 
 # Requires translation!
Tile improvements\nIn Civilzation V, workers start working on an improvement-under-construction at the beginning of movement. Unciv changes this, to allow players to assign workers to tiles, and then reconsider and change improvement or move them elsewhere. = 
 # Requires translation!
Forest and Jungle Visibility\nIn Unciv, forests and jungles are visible 1 tile outside visibility range. In Civilization V, this is the behaviour of hills and mountains, but not of forests and jungles, yet jungle and forest can block hills, and hill + forest can block mountain, indicating they're on the same elevation. This is considered to be a bug in the otherwise well-structured visibility logic in Civilization V. = 
 # Requires translation!
City razing\nIn Civilization V, the player can never raze any of the cities he/she founded. Not applicable to Unciv. = 

Founding Cities\nThe Settler is a unit that can found a new city. You can build a Settler unit in a city with at least 2 population, and then move them to a good location to found a new city. This will usually be your main way of acquiring more cities. = Urbem condere\nColonus est centuria quae potest novam urbem condere. Potes in urbe cum multitudine non pauciore quam 2 aedificare colonum, et tum movere eum ad locum bonum ad condendum novam urbem. Hoc vulgo sit modus tuus principalis de acquirendo plures urbes.
Food conversion to Production\nDuring the construction of a Settler, the city will not grow. Instead, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and from there on every 4th, excess Food (Growth) is converted into Production, with the rest of the excess Food being lost. = Versio a cibo ad fabricationem\nQuom colonus construitur, urbs non augeatur. Autem primus, secundus et quartus cibus ("auctus") superfluus, et quartus de quaternis usque dehinc, in fabricationem vertantur, cum eo quod alius cibus amittatur.
