# In English we just paste all these conditionals at the end of each unique, but in your language that

# where they should go. 
# The first determines whether the conditionals should be placed before or after the base unique.
# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

 # Requires translation!
ConditionalsPlacement = 

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.

Ave Caesar Augustus, Emperor of Rome and Dominus of the Roman Empire! Your empire was the most powerful and feared of all in Western civilization.

Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you! India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land. Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty. For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders. In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place. In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority. After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history! =

Aloha to Kamehameha the Great, who the heavens allowed to unite your people!

As the first King of Hawai'i, law and taxation systems were stabilized, and you promoted the Mamalahoe Kawanai, an edict to protect civilian people in times of war. Unification and sovereignty of all the islands continued thanks to your fair laws and deeds, even after you joined your ancestors in paradise in 1819. =

O Great King Ramkhamhaeng, the Siamese people obey you with respect and fear! The beautiful and mysterious land of Siam is an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia, which was besieged by many foes, plagued by bloody war and great poverty, but eventually the smart and loyal Siamese people have endured and triumphed. Siam was a part of the Khmer Empire until the 13th century AD, before its brave people took arms and led a revolution to form the small Sukhothai kingdom. After many battles and diplomacy prowess, this tiny kingdom became a mighty empire, which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century. =

The Spanish culture had taken the best of the Christian and Muslim worlds, and was ready to dominate the world for centuries.

Askia, leader of the Songhai people and greatest of all, may God watch your path towards glory! Songhai was under the rule of the mighty West African state of Mali until the middle of the 14th century. Great King Sunni Ali Ber fought for independance, and showed to all Songhai's power, by conquering territories and repelling many foes who sought to destroy the rising kingdom. Ultimately, conquest of the wealthy cities of Timbuktu and Jenne made Songhai an empire with enough economic power to survive for a century, until the empire bowed down before foes with advanced technology - muskets against spearmen. =

O divine Montezuma, your people welcome you! May your magnificence inspire all living things! The mighty Aztecs were nomads until the 12th century, when they choose to settle in the mesa central, which would later be called Mexico. Wars were frequent with other tribes to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zampango. In some 200 years, double-sided alliances and martial prowess made of the Aztecs the dominant power in the Central American basin, forming a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea. Alas, the empire fell under the assault of foreign devils - the Spaniards and many curses they brought with them! Wars between tribes and weaponry of doom used by the invaders made the great Aztec civilization crumble in only a few decades. =

Greetings to the wise and brave Prince William of Orange, who freed the Netherlands and gave strength to the Dutch people. In 1568, you led a rebellion against Spanish dominion, to gain freedom for your people, and therefore starting the Eighty Years' War. Your actions were all aimed to create one of Europe's first modern republics, the Seven United Provinces. The rebellion was the meaning of your very life and death, as it was also the cause of your assassination in 1584. But your death has given even more pride and courage to your people, to fight for liberty against any oppressors. Carved in history as the 'Father of the Fatherland', your name is a symbol of Dutch independence for eternity. =

In the late 520's AD, you helped your husband engage in spiritual and legal reforms, promugalting numerous laws to improve women's status and treatment in the empire. You also made of Constantinople the jewel of the Eastern Roman Empire with the restoration and construction of many aqueducts, bridges, and churches, its beauty culminating with the creation of the Hagia Sophia, one of the most splendid pieces of architecture in the world. =

Many legions fell under your fierce attacks and you burned the city of London with your anger. While the Romans still kept ownership of your land after your final defeat, your actions nonetheless showed Rome that this land could never be fully conquered, making Nero himself consider to withdraw all troops and leaving Britain forever. =

Introduction = Innføring
Welcome to Unciv!\nBecause this is a complex game, there are basic tasks to help familiarize you with the game.\nThese are completely optional, and you're welcome to explore the game on your own! = Velkomen til Unciv!\nFor di dette er eit innfløkt spel er det nokre grunnleggjande oppgåver som kan gjera deg litt kjend med det.\nDesse er fullstendig valfrie, gjerne utforska spelet å eiga hand om du vil det helst!

Your first mission is to found your capital city.\nThis is actually an important task because your capital city will probably be your most prosperous.\nMany game bonuses apply only to your capital city and it will probably be the center of your empire. = Ditt fyrste oppdrag er å tufta din eigen hovudstad.\nDette er veldig viktig å gjera for di hovudstaden din vert høgst sannsynleg den mest velståande.\nDet er mange spelbonusar som berre gjeld hovudstaden med di dette truleg vert kjerna i riket ditt.
How do you know a spot is appropriate?\nThat’s not an easy question to answer, but looking for and building next to luxury resources is a good rule of thumb.\nLuxury resources are tiles that have things like gems, cotton, or silk (indicated by a smiley next to the resource icon)\nThese resources make your civilization happy. You should also keep an eye out for resources needed to build units, such as iron. Cities cannot be built within 3 tiles of existing cities, which is another thing to watch out for! = Korleis veit ein at ein stad er høvande?\nDet er slett ikkje lett å svara på, likevel er det veldig lurt å leita etter og byggja nære luksusressursar.\nRuter med edelsteinar, bomull eller silke er luksusressursar (vist med eit smilefjes ved sidan av ressursteiknet)\nDet er slike ressursar som gjer innbyggjarane dine glade. Du må ogso vera på vakt etter ressursar du treng for å laga troppar, som jarn til dømes. Ein annan ting du må passa på er at byane dine ikkje er bygde inntil 3 ruter til byar som alt finst!
 # Requires translation!
However, cities don’t have a set area that they can work - more on that later!\nThis means you don’t have to settle cities right next to resources.\nLet’s say, for example, that you want access to some iron – but the resource is right next to a desert.\nYou don’t have to settle your city next to the desert. You can settle a few tiles away in more prosperous lands.\nYour city will grow and eventually gain access to the resource.\nYou only need to settle right next to resources if you need them immediately – \n   which might be the case now and then, but you’ll usually have the luxury of time. = 
 # Requires translation!
The first thing coming out of your city should be either a Scout or Warrior.\nI generally prefer the Warrior because it can be used for defense and because it can be upgraded\n  to the Swordsman unit later in the game for a relatively modest sum of gold.\nScouts can be effective, however, if you seem to be located in an area of dense forest and hills.\nScouts don’t suffer a movement penalty in this terrain.\nIf you’re a veteran of the 4x strategy genre your first Warrior or Scout will be followed by a Settler.\nFast expanding is absolutely critical in most games of this type. = 

 # Requires translation!
In your first couple of turns, you will have very little options, but as your civilization grows, so do the number of things requiring your attention. = 

Culture and Policies = Kultur og Vedtekter
 # Requires translation!
Each turn, the culture you gain from all your cities is added to your Civilization's culture.\nWhen you have enough culture, you may pick a Social Policy, each one giving you a certain bonus. = 
The policies are organized into branches, with each branch providing a bonus ability when all policies in the branch have been adopted. = Vedtektene er sett opp i greiner, der kvar grein gjev ei tilleggsevne når alle vedtektene i den greina har vorte vedteke.
With each policy adopted, and with each city built,\n  the cost of adopting another policy rises - so choose wisely! = Med kvar vedtekt som er vedteke og med kvar by bygt,\n so aukar kostnaden på å vedtaka ei ny vedtekt- vel med omhug!

City Expansion = Byutviding
Once a city has gathered enough Culture, it will expand into a neighboring tile.\nYou have no control over the tile it will expand into, but tiles with resources and higher yields are prioritized. = So snart ein by har samla opp nok Kultur, utvider han til ei rute som er ved han.\nEin har ikkje noko å seia over kva for rute byen utvider til, men ruter med ressursar og større utbyte vert prioritert.
 # Requires translation!
Each additional tile will require more culture, but generally your first cities will eventually expand to a wide tile range. = 
 # Requires translation!
Although your city will keep expanding forever, your citizens can only work 3 tiles away from city center.\nThis should be taken into account when placing new cities. = 

 # Requires translation!
As cities grow in size and influence, you have to deal with a happiness mechanic that is no longer tied to each individual city.\nInstead, your entire empire shares the same level of satisfaction.\nAs your cities grow in population you’ll find that it is more and more difficult to keep your empire happy. = 
 # Requires translation!
In addition, you can’t even build any city improvements that increase happiness until you’ve done the appropriate research.\nIf your empire’s happiness ever goes below zero the growth rate of your cities will be hurt.\nIf your empire becomes severely unhappy (as indicated by the smiley-face icon at the top of the interface)\n  your armies will have a big penalty slapped on to their overall combat effectiveness. = 
 # Requires translation!
This means that it is very difficult to expand quickly in Unciv.\nIt isn’t impossible, but as a new player you probably shouldn't do it.\nSo what should you do? Chill out, scout, and improve the land that you do have by building Workers.\nOnly build new cities once you have found a spot that you believe is appropriate. = 

Unhappiness = Uglede
It seems that your citizens are unhappy!\nWhile unhappy, your civilization will suffer many detrimental effects, increasing in severity as unhappiness gets higher. = Det verkar som innbyggjarane dine er lei seg!\nNår dei er lei seg, lid sivilisasjonen din av mange skadelege krafter, og vert verre di meir uglede ein har.
Unhappiness has two main causes: Population and cities.\n  Each city causes 3 unhappiness, and each population, 1 = Uglede har to hovudårsaker: Folkemengd og byar.\n  Kvar by er årsak til 3 i uglede, og kvar folkemengd, 1
 # Requires translation!
There are 2 main ways to combat unhappiness:\n  by building happiness buildings for your population\n  or by having improved luxury resources within your borders. = 

You have entered a Golden Age!\nGolden age points are accumulated each turn by the total happiness \n  of your civilization\nWhen in a golden age, culture and production generation increases +20%,\n  and every tile already providing at least one gold will provide an extra gold. = Du er gått inn i ein Gullalder!\nGullalderpoeng vert samla opp kvar tur av den totale gleda \n  av sivilisasjonen din\nI ein gullalder, aukar kultur og produksjonsgenerering med +20%,\n  og kvar rute som alt gjev minst eitt gull gjev no attpåtil eitt gull.

Roads and Railroads = Vegar og Jarnvegar
 # Requires translation!
Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 

Victory Types = Sigerstypar
 # Requires translation!
Once you’ve settled your first two or three cities you’re probably 100 to 150 turns into the game.\nNow is a good time to start thinking about how, exactly, you want to win – if you haven’t already. = 
 # Requires translation!
There are four ways to win in Unciv. They are:\n - Cultural Victory: Complete 5 Social Policy Trees and build the Utopia Project\n - Domination Victory: Survive as the last civilization\n - Science Victory: Be the first to construct a spaceship to Alpha Centauri\n - Diplomatic Victory: Build the United Nations and win the vote = 
 # Requires translation!
So to sum it up, these are the basics of Unciv – Found a prosperous first city, expand slowly to manage happiness, and set yourself up for the victory condition you wish to pursue.\nObviously, there is much more to it than that, but it is important not to jump into the deep end before you know how to swim. = 

Enemy City = Fiendleg by
 # Requires translation!
Cities can be conquered by reducing their health to 1, and entering the city with a melee unit.\nSince cities heal each turn, it is best to attack with ranged units and use your melee units to defend them until the city has been defeated! = 

Luxury Resource = Luksusvare
 # Requires translation!
Luxury resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nEach unique Luxury resource you have adds 5 happiness to your civilization, but extra resources of the same type don't add anything, so use them for trading with other civilizations! = 

Strategic Resource = Strategisk vare
 # Requires translation!
Strategic resources within your domain and with their specific improvement are connected to your trade network.\nStrategic resources allow you to train units and construct buildings that require those specific resources, for example the Horseman requires Horses. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unlike Luxury Resources, each Strategic Resource on the map provides more than one of that resource.\nThe top bar keeps count of how many unused strategic resources you own.\nA full drilldown of resources is available in the Resources tab in the Overview screen. = 

The city can no longer put up any resistance!\nHowever, to conquer it, you must enter the city with a melee unit = Byen kan ikkje stå imot lenger!\nLikevel, for å hærtaka byen må du ha ein nærstridande tropp til å gå inn i han

After Conquering = Etter Hærtaking
 # Requires translation!
When conquering a city, you can choose to liberate, annex, puppet, or raze the city. = 
 # Requires translation!
\nLiberating the city will return it to its original owner, giving you a massive diplomatic boost with them!\n\nAnnexing the city will give you full control over it, but also increase the citizens' unhappiness to 2x!\nThis can be mitigated by building a courthouse in the city, returning the citizen's unhappiness to normal.\n\nPuppeting the city will mean that you have no control on the city's production.\nThe city will not increase your tech or policy cost.\nA puppeted city can be annexed at any time, but annexed cities cannot be returned to a puppeted state!\n\nRazing the city will lower its population by 1 each turn until the city is destroyed!\nYou cannot raze a city that is either the starting capital of a civilization or the holy city of a religion. = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 

 # Requires translation!
You have encountered another civilization!\nOther civilizations start out peaceful, and you can trade with them,\n  but they may choose to declare war on you later on = 

 # Requires translation!
Once you have completed the Apollo Program, you can start constructing spaceship parts in your cities\n (with the relevant technologies) to win a Scientific Victory! = 

Injured Units = Såra troppar
 # Requires translation!
Injured units deal less damage, but recover after turns that they have been inactive.\nUnits heal 10 health per turn in enemy territory or neutral land,\n  20 inside your territory and 25 in your cities. = 

Workers = Arbeidarar
Workers are vital to your cities' growth, since only they can construct improvements on tiles.\nImprovements raise the yield of your tiles, allowing your city to produce more and grow faster while working the same amount of tiles! = Arbeidarar er livsnaudsynte til at byane dine veks, for berre dei kan byggja betringar på ruter.\nBetringar aukar utbytet i rutene dine, som lèt byen din produsere meir og vakse snarare med du jobbar med det same talet på ruter!

 # Requires translation!
Siege Units = 
 # Requires translation!
Siege units are extremely powerful against cities, but need to be Set Up before they can attack.\nOnce your siege unit is set up, it can attack from the current tile,\n  but once moved to another tile, it will need to be set up again. = 

Embarking = Å leggja ut på
 # Requires translation!
Once a certain tech is researched, your land units can embark, allowing them to traverse water tiles.\nEntering or leaving water takes the entire turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units are defenseless while embarked (cannot use modifiers), and have a fixed Defending Strength based on your tech Era, so be careful!\nRanged Units can't attack, Melee Units have a Strength penalty, and all have limited vision. = 

Idle Units = Ventande Troppar
 # Requires translation!
If you don't want to move a unit this turn, you can skip it by clicking 'Next unit' again.\nIf you won't be moving it for a while, you can have the unit enter Fortify or Sleep mode - \n  units in Fortify or Sleep are not considered idle units.\nIf you have not decided yet what an unit should do for the current turn, choose the 'Wait' command. A 'waiting' unit will be selected again at the end of the 'Next Unit' cycle, once all other units have received their orders.\nIf you want to disable the 'Next unit' feature entirely, you can toggle it in Menu -> Check for idle units. = 

Contact Me = Tak kontakt
 # Requires translation!
Hi there! If you've played this far, you've probably seen that the game is currently incomplete.\n Unciv is meant to be open-source and free, forever.\n That means no ads or any other nonsense. = 
 # Requires translation!
What motivates me to keep working on it, \n  besides the fact I think it's amazingly cool that I can,\n  is the support from the players - you guys are the best! = 
 # Requires translation!
Every rating and review that I get puts a smile on my face =)\n  So contact me! Send me an email, review, Github issue\n  or mail pigeon, and let's figure out how to make the game \n  even more awesome!\n(Contact info is in the Play Store) = 

Pillaging = Plyndring
 # Requires translation!
Military units can pillage improvements, which heals them 25 health and ruins the improvement.\nThe tile can still be worked, but advantages from the improvement - stat bonuses and resources - will be lost.\nWorkers can repair these improvements, which takes less time than building the improvement from scratch.\nPillaging certain improvements will result in your units looting gold from the improvement. = 

Experience = Erfaring
 # Requires translation!
Units that enter combat gain experience, which can then be used on promotions for that unit.\nUnits gain more experience when in Melee combat than Ranged, and more when attacking than when defending. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. = 

Combat = Slag
 # Requires translation!
Unit and cities are worn down by combat, which is affected by a number of different values.\nEach unit has a certain 'base' combat value, which can be improved by certain conditions, promotions and locations. = 
 # Requires translation!
Units use the 'Strength' value as the base combat value when melee attacking and when defending.\nWhen using a ranged attack, they will the use the 'Ranged Strength' value instead. = 
 # Requires translation!
Ranged attacks can be done from a distance, dependent on the 'Range' value of the unit.\nWhile melee attacks allow the defender to damage the attacker in retaliation, ranged attacks do not. = 

Research Agreements = Forskingsavtaler
 # Requires translation!
In research agreements, you and another civilization decide to jointly research technology.\nAt the end of the agreement, you will both receive a 'lump sum' of Science, which will go towards one of your unresearched technologies. = 
 # Requires translation!
The amount of ⍾Science you receive at the end is dependent on the ⍾Science generated by your cities and the other civilization's cities during the agreement - the more, the better! = 

Defensive Pacts = Forsvarspaktar
 # Requires translation!
Defensive pacts allow you and another civ to protect one another from aggressors.\nOnce the defensive pact is signed, you will be drawn into their future defensive wars, just as they will be drawn into your future defensive wars. Declaring war on any Civ will remove all of your defensive pacts. You will have to re-sign them to use their effect. = 
Be cautious when signing defensive pacts because they can bring you into wars that you might not want to be in. = Ver varsam med kven du går inn i forsvarspaktar med, for dei kan draga deg i stridar du truleg ikkje vil vera med i.
The AI is very careful and will not accept defensive pacts with less than 80 influence. = KI-en er veldig varsam og skriv ikkje under på forsvarspaktar med mindre enn 80 innverknad på dei.

 # Requires translation!
Not all nations are contending with you for victory.\nCity-States are nations that can't win, can't be traded with, and instead confer certain bonuses to friendly civilizations. = 
 # Requires translation!
Instead, diplomatic relations with City-States are determined by Influence - a meter of 'how much the City-State likes you'.\nInfluence can be increased by attacking their enemies, liberating their city, and giving them sums of gold. = 
 # Requires translation!
Certain bonuses are given when you are at above 30 influence.\nWhen you have above 60 Influence, and you have the highest influence with them of all civilizations, you are considered their 'Ally', and gain further bonuses and access to the Luxury and Strategic resources in their lands. = 

Great People = Store menn
Certain buildings, and specialists in cities, generate Great Person points per turn.\nThere are several types of Great People, and their points accumulate separately.\nThe number of points per turn and accumulated points can be viewed in the Overview screen. = Det er visse bygnader, i tillegg til spesialistar i byar, som haustar inn "Stor Person"-poeng for kvar tur.\nDet finst ulike typar Store menn som alle samlar poeng kvar for seg.\nTalet på poeng for kvar tur og oppsamla poeng finn ein på Oversynsskjermen.
Alternatively, the Great Person points breakdown per city can be viewed in each city screen (see UI Tips article). = Ein kan elles sjå "Stor Person"-poengteljinga i kvar byskjerm (sjå artikkelen om Vink åt Brukargrensesnittet).
 # Requires translation!
Once enough points have been accumulated, a Great Person of that type will be created!\nEach Great Person can construct a certain Great Improvement which gives large yields over time, or immediately consumed to provide a certain bonus now. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great Improvements also provide any strategic resources that are under them, so you don't need to worry if resources are revealed underneath your improvements! = 

Removing Terrain Features = Fjerna Terrengdrag
 # Requires translation!
Certain tiles have terrain features - like Flood plains or Forests -  on top of them. Some of these layers, like Jungle, Marsh and Forest, can be removed by workers.\nRemoving the terrain feature does not remove any resources in the tile, and is usually required in order to add improvements exploiting those resources. = 

 # Requires translation!
Natural Wonders, such as the Mt. Fuji, the Rock of Gibraltar and the Great Barrier Reef, are unique, impassable terrain features, masterpieces of mother Nature, which possess exceptional qualities that make them very different from the average terrain.\nThey benefit by giving you large sums of Culture, Science, Gold or Production if worked by your Cities, which is why you might need to bring them under your empire as soon as possible. = 

Keyboard = Tastatur
If you have a keyboard, some shortcut keys become available. Unit command or improvement picker keys, for example, are shown directly in their corresponding buttons. = Om du har eit tastatur er det visse snøggtastar du kan bruka. Til dømes, er troppordre- eller betringsveljarknappar beint viste i dei tilsvarande knappane.
On the world screen the hotkeys are as follows: = På verdsskjermen er snøggtastane som fylgjer:

 # Requires translation!
What you don't see: The phone/tablet's back button will pop the question whether you wish to leave Unciv and go back to Real Life. On desktop versions, you can use the ESC key. = 

 # Requires translation!
When at later stages of the game, you might have a lot of units but only a little to do. To help you we have implemented an AutoPlay feature that lets you use the AI to play part or all of your turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
To enable AutoPlay, go to options and open the AutoPlay tab and press "Show AutoPlay button". = 
 # Requires translation!
Clicking on the AutoPlay button opens a popup menue for choosing to AutoPlay parts or all of your turn. = 
 # Requires translation!
Clicking Start AutoPlay in the pop-up menue or long pressing the AutoPlay button begins the multi-turn AutoPlay. This will play your next turns as if you were an AI. = 
 # Requires translation!
To cancel multi-turn AutoPlay you can press the AutoPlay button, next turn button or open the options menue. = 
 # Requires translation!
Multi-turn AutoPlay is not advised on harder difficulty levels as your AI will not play better against an AI with modifiers. = 
 # Requires translation!
Multi-turn AutoPlay for multiplayer is not yet supported. = 

After building a shrine, your civilization will start generating ☮Faith. = Etter å ha bygt eit skrin, so byrjar sivilisasjonen din å hauste inn ☮Tru
When enough ☮Faith has been generated, you will be able to found a pantheon. = Når sivilisasjonen din har hausta inn nok ☮Tru, so kan du tufta ein panteon.
A pantheon will provide a small bonus for your civilization that will apply to all cities that have it as a majority religion. = Ein panteon gjev ein liten bonus åt sivilisasjonen din som gjeld alle byar med den religionen som storpart.
Each civilization can only choose a single pantheon belief, and each pantheon can only be chosen once. = Kvar sivilisasjon får berre velja éin enkelt panteonstru
Generating more ☮Faith will allow you to found a religion. = Innhausting av meir ☮Tru lèt deg til å tufta ein religion.

 # Requires translation!
Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
This great prophet can be used for multiple things: Constructing a holy site, founding a religion and spreading your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
When founding your religion, you may choose another two beliefs. The founder belief will only apply to you, while the follower belief will apply to all cities following your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, the city where you used your great prophet will become the holy city of that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Once you have founded a religion, great prophets will keep being born every so often, though the amount of Faith☮ you have to save up will be higher. = 
 # Requires translation!
One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
This will allow you to choose another follower belief, as well as an enhancer belief, that only applies to you. = 
 # Requires translation!
Do take care founding a religion soon, only about half the players in the game are able to found a religion! = 

Beliefs = Truer
There are four types of beliefs: Pantheon, Founder, Follower and Enhancer beliefs. = Det er fire tru
 # Requires translation!
Pantheon and Follower beliefs apply to each city following your religion, while Founder and Enhancer beliefs only apply to the founder of a religion. = 

Religion inside cities = Religion i byar
When founding a city, it won't follow a religion immediately. = I det ein byer tufta, har han ikkje ein religion med det fyrste.
The religion a city follows depends on the total pressure each religion has within the city. = Religionen ein by fylgjer
 # Requires translation!
Followers are allocated in the same proportions as these pressures, and these followers can be viewed in the city screen. = 
 # Requires translation!
You are allowed to check religious followers and pressures in cities you do not own by selecting them. = 
 # Requires translation!
In both places, a tap/click on the icon of a religion will show detailed information with its effects. = 
 # Requires translation!
Based on this, you can get a feel for which religions have a lot of pressure built up in the city, and which have almost none. = 
 # Requires translation!
The city follows a religion if a majority of its population follows that religion, and will only then receive the effects of Follower and Pantheon beliefs of that religion. = 

Spreading Religion = Å spreia religion
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = Religionsspreiing hender naturleg, men ein kan skunda det med misjonærar eller store profetar.
 # Requires translation!
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 
 # Requires translation!
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Great prophets always have your religion when they appear, even if they are bought in cities following other religions, but captured great prophets do retain their original religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Both great prophets and missionaries are able to spread religion to cities when they are inside its borders, even cities of other civilizations. = 
 # Requires translation!
These two units can even enter tiles of civilizations with whom you don't have an open borders agreement! = 
 # Requires translation!
But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 
 # Requires translation!
This diminishes their effectiveness when spreading religion, and if their religious strength ever reaches 0, they have lost their faith and disappear. = 
 # Requires translation!
When you do spread your religion, the religious strength of the unit is added as pressure for that religion. = 
 # Requires translation!
Cities also passively add pressure of their majority religion to nearby cities. = 
 # Requires translation!
Each city provides +6 pressure per turn to all cities within 10 tiles, though the exact amount of pressure depends on the game speed. = 
 # Requires translation!
This pressure can also be seen in the city screen, and gives you an idea of how religions in your cities will evolve if you don't do anything. = 
 # Requires translation!
Holy cities also provide +30 pressure of the religion founded there to themselves, making it very difficult to effectively convert a holy city. = 
 # Requires translation!
Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. = 
 # Requires translation!
This way, all your cities will starting following your pantheon as long as you haven't founded a religion yet. = 

Inquisitors = Inkvisitorar
Inquisitors are the last religious unit, and their strength is removing other religions. = Inkvisitorar er den siste troppen som påverkar religion, dei har som styrke å fjerna andre religionar.
They can remove all other religions from one of your own cities, removing any pressures built up. = Dei fjernar alle andre religionar enn din frå éin av dine eigne byar, dette lettar på trykk som har bygt seg opp.
Great prophets also have this ability, and remove all other religions in the city when spreading their religion. = Store profetar har ogso denne evna og fjernar alle andre religionane i byen der profetane spreier religionen sin.
Often this results in the city immediately converting to their religion = Dette endar ofte med at byen konverterer til religionen deira.
 # Requires translation!
Additionally, when an inquisitor is stationed in or directly next to a city center, units of other religions cannot spread their faith there, though natural spread is uneffected. = 

 # Requires translation!
The Mayan unique ability, 'The Long Count', comes with a side effect: = 
 # Requires translation!
Once active, the game's year display will use mayan notation. = 
 # Requires translation!
The Maya measured time in days from what we would call 11th of August, 3114 BCE. A day is called K'in, 20 days are a Winal, 18 Winals are a Tun, 20 Tuns are a K'atun, 20 K'atuns are a B'ak'tun, 20 B'ak'tuns a Piktun, and so on. = 
 # Requires translation!
Unciv only displays ය B'ak'tuns, ඹ K'atuns and ම Tuns (from left to right) since that is enough to approximate gregorian calendar years. The Maya numerals are pretty obvious to understand. Have fun deciphering them! = 

 # Requires translation!
Your cities will periodically demand different luxury goods to satisfy their desire for new things in life. = 
 # Requires translation!
If you manage to acquire the demanded luxury by trade, expansion, or conquest, the city will celebrate We Love The King Day for 20 turns. = 
 # Requires translation!
During the We Love The King Day, the city will grow 25% faster. = 
 # Requires translation!
This means exploration and trade is important to grow your cities! = 

 # Requires translation!
Air Sweeps = 
 # Requires translation!
Fighter units are able to perform Air Sweeps over a tile helping clear out potential enemy Air, Sea, or Land Interceptions that can reach that tile. = 
 # Requires translation!
While this Action will take an Attack, the benefit is drawing out Interceptions to help protect your other Air Units. Especially your Bombers. = 
 # Requires translation!
Your unit will always draw an Interception, if one can reach the target tile, even if the Intercepting unit has a chance to miss. = 
 # Requires translation!
If the Interceptor is not an Air Unit (eg Land or Sea), the Air Sweeping unit and Interceptor take no damage! = 
 # Requires translation!
If the Interceptor is an Air Unit, the two units will damage each other in a straight fight with no Interception bonuses. And only the Attacking Air Sweep Unit gets any Air Sweep strength bonuses. = 

 # Requires translation!
City Tile Blockade = 
 # Requires translation!
One of your tiles is blocked by an enemy: when an enemy unit stands on a tile you own, the tile will not produce yields and cannot be worked by a city this turn. City will reallocate population from a blocked tile automatically. = 
 # Requires translation!
Enemy military land units block tiles they are standing on. Enemy military naval units additionally block adjacent water tiles. To protect your tiles from blockade, place a friendly military unit on it or fight off invaders. = 

 # Requires translation!
City Blockade = 
 # Requires translation!
One of your cities is under a naval blockade! When all adjacent water tiles of a coastal city are blocked - city loses harbor connection to all other cities, including capital. Make sure to de-blockade cities by deploying friendly military naval units to fight off invaders. = 

Keyboard Bindings = Tastebindingar
Limitations = Avgrensingar
 # Requires translation!
This is a work in progress. = 
 # Requires translation!
For technical reasons, only direct keys or Ctrl-Letter combinations can be used. = 
 # Requires translation!
The Escape key is intentionally excluded from being reassigned. = 
Using the Keys page = Å bruka sida for Tastar
 # Requires translation!
Each binding has a button with an image looking like this: = 
 # Requires translation!
While hovering the mouse over the key button, you can press a desired key directly to assign it. = 
Double-click the image to reset the binding to default. = Trykk to gonger på biletet for å stilla attende bindinga til det vanlege.
 # Requires translation!
Bindings mapped to their default keys are displayed in gray, those reassigned by you in white. = 
 # Requires translation!
Conflicting assignments are marked red. Conflicts can exist across categories, like World Screen / Unit Actions. Note that at the moment, the game does not prevent saving conflicting assignments, though the result may be unexpected. = 
For discussion about missing entries, see the linked github issue. = Sjå vedlagd github-sak for drøfting om vantande oppslag

Welcome to the Civilopedia! = Velkomen til Civilopedien!
Here you can find information - general help, rules, and what makes up the game world. = Her finn du informasjon - ålmenn hjelp, reglar og det som gjer opp spelverda.
How to find information = Slik finn det du lurer på

Each category has a list of entries on the left of the screen, sorted alphabetically (with few exceptions). Clicking an entry will update the center pane were you are currently reading this. = Kvar kategori har ei oppslagsliste på venstre side av skjermen, innretta alfabetisk (med visse unnatak). Trykkjer du på eit oppslag so oppdaterer den mellomste ruta som du les i no.
Lines can link to other Civilopedia entries, they are marked with a chain link symbol like this one. You can click anywhere on the line to follow the link. = Liner kan visa til andre Civilopedi-oppslag, då er dei merkte med eit teikn av ein lekkje slik som denne. Du kan trykkja kvar som helst på lina for opna lenkja.
The current category is special - all articles on general concepts are here. It is called 'Tutorials' because you can revisit these here, too. = Denne kategorien er særmerkt - alle artiklane om ålmenne konsept finn ein her. Det heiter 'Rettleiingar' for di ein kan sjå dei om att her, òg
What information can I find = Desse opplysingane finn du her
The data shown is not dependent on your current game's situation, e.g. bonuses for the nation you are playing or difficulty modifiers will not affect the numbers. = Dataen vist her spørst ikkje på den noverande stoda i spelet ditt, t.d. bonusar til det landet du spelar eller vanskegradskoeffisientar endrar ikkje på tala.
However, it will reflect the mods you are playing! The combination of base ruleset and extension mods you select define the rules of a game, what objects exist and how they interact, and the Civilopedia mirrors these rules. = Likevel speglar det moddane du spelar med! Kombinasjonen av grunnregelverka og utvidarmoddane du vel legg til grunn reglane åt eit spel, kva gjenstandar som finst og korleis dei spelar saman, desse reglane speglar ogso Civilopediet.
If you opened the Civilopedia from the main menu, the "Ruleset" will be that of the last game you started. = Dersom du opna Civilopediet frå hovudmenyen er 'Regelverket' teke frå det siste spelet du byrja.
 # Requires translation!
