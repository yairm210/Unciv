# It should be translated with only the untranslated english word 'before' or 'after', without the quotes.
# Example: In the unique "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units>", should the <for [unitFilter] units>
# be translated before or after the "+20% Strength"?

# The second determines the exact ordering of all conditionals that are to be translated.
# ALL conditionals that exist will be part of this line, and they may be moved around and rearranged as you please.
# However, you should not translate the parts between the brackets, only move them around so that when
# translated in your language the sentence sounds natural.
#
# Example: "+20% Strength <for [unitFilter] units> <when attacking> <vs [unitFilter] units> <in [tileFilter] tiles> <during the [eraName]>"
# In what order should these conditionals between <> be translated?
# Note that this example currently doesn't make sense yet, as those conditionals do not exist, but they will in the future.
#
# As this is still under development, conditionals will be added al the time. As a result,
# any translations added for this string will be removed immediately in the next version when more
# conditionals are added. As we don't want to make you retranslate this same line over and over,
# it's removed for now, but it will return once all planned conditionals have been added.
