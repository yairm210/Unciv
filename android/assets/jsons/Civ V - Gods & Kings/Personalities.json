      Here is a template to show what values should be filled in. 
      Use the description at http://civdata.com/, and adjust the numbers accordingly.
      Even then, its up to personal interpretation.
      To generate lines with multiple parameters I used the function: (FirstParam + (SecondParam - 5) / 2)
      Note: BNW leaders are included for now.
