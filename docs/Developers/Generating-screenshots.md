# Generating Screenshots

Images are the first way that a player viscerally connects to the game,
and so making our screenshots better leads to a direct increase in interest.

For us to continue to generate screenshots as the UI improves, we have a saved game named "ScreenshotGenerationGame" in the extraImages folder.

The easiest way to create screenshots is by:
- WRITE DOWN which file you're working on! They all look the same!
- Editing the gamesettings.json to the required height/width
- Loading the ScreenshotGenerationGame
- Centering on Elephantine
- Selecting the top-right Keshik, then clicking on Elephantine
- Screenshotting the entire window
- Cropping the area off the top (I use Shutter on Ubuntu for the above 2 steps)
- Save!

Quick dimensions checklist for y'all!
