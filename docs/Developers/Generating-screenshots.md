# Generating Screenshots

Images are the first way that a player viscerally connects to the game,
and so making our screenshots better leads to a direct increase in interest.

For us to continue to generate screenshots as the UI improves, we have a saved game named "ScreenshotGenerationGame" in the extraImages folder.

The easiest way to create screenshots is by:

- WRITE DOWN which file you're working on! They all look the same!
- Editing the gamesettings.json to the required height/width
- Loading the ScreenshotGenerationGame
- Centering on Elephantine
- Selecting the top-right Keshik, then clicking on Elephantine
- Screenshotting the entire window
- Cropping the area off the top (I use Shutter on Ubuntu for the above 2 steps)
- Save!

Quick dimensions checklist for y'all!

- Github preview image - 1280*640
- Feature Graphic - Google Play - 1024*500 - best in 900x600 resolution (options - display)
- Itch.io image - 630*500 - best in 1050x700 resolution

# Generating Steam images with Gimp

- Open map editor
- Take a screenshot of a nice-looking piece of map in the required dimensions (I use Shutter)
- Take the latest Unciv icon, add as another layer, and resize the layer until it's like 90% of the height
- Go here: https://text.imageonline.co/ and select color-black, font-Nobile, and Bold.
- Generate text in a good size to fit into the rest of your image, screenshot that (with the white background) and paste in a new layer
- Use the Bucket Fill, mode-erase, with opacity to get rid of most of the white, this should leave a small outline of white around our black text!
