## Water melee units can attack land units on shore

A result of a Discord poll. Water melee units in Civ V are considerably underpowered, so much so that even on maps with water they weren't considered competitive.

This change brings back an edge to water melee units that makes them worth building.

## Workers do not complete an improvement on the same turn - they get orders to work on it

This allows players to assign workers to improve tiles, and then to reconsider and change improvement or move them elsewhere.

Building stuff takes time!

## Forests and Jungle are visible 1 tile outside visibility range

In Civ V, this is the behavior of Hills and Mountains, but not of Jungle and Forest.

And yet, Jungle and Forest *can block* Hills, and Hills+Forest can block Mountains from view - so they must be the same height!

This part of Civ V visibility makes no sense, considering the otherwise well-structured visibility logic, and we consider this to be a bug.

## Great Warpath does not provide railroad bonuses for connected cities

This is [a discrepancy in Civ V rules](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/issues/12261) - if all jungles are like roads, then they shouldn't be considered railroads for production purposes.

The idea is that if you can quickly transport goods with railroads that yields a production bonus - moving fast through jungles may be possible, but not with industrial amounts of goods.
