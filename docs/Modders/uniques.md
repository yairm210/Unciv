# Uniques
An overview of uniques can be found [here](../Developers/Uniques.md)

Simple unique parameters are explained by mouseover. Complex parameters are explained in [Unique parameter types](Unique-parameters.md)

## Triggerable uniques
!!! note ""

    Uniques that have immediate, one-time effects. These can be added to techs to trigger when researched, to policies to trigger when adopted, to eras to trigger when reached, to buildings to trigger when built. Alternatively, you can add a TriggerCondition to them to make them into Global uniques that activate upon a specific event.They can also be added to units to grant them the ability to trigger this effect as an action, which can be modified with UnitActionModifier and UnitTriggerCondition conditionals.

??? example  "Triggers the following global alert: [comment]"
	Supported on Policies and Technologies.

	For other targets, the generated Notification may not read nicely, and will likely not support translation. Reason: Your [comment] gets a generated introduction, other triggers usually notify _you_, not _others_, and that difference is currently handled by mapping text.

	Conditionals evaluate in the context of the civilization having the Unique, not the recipients of the alerts.

	Example: "Triggers the following global alert: [comment]"

	This unique is automatically hidden from users.

	Applicable to: Triggerable

??? example  "Suppress warning [validationWarning]"
	Allows suppressing specific validation warnings. Errors, deprecation warnings, or warnings about untyped and non-filtering uniques should be heeded, not suppressed, and are therefore not accepted. Note that this can be used in ModOptions, in the uniques a warning is about, or as modifier on the unique triggering a warning - but you still need to be specific. Even in the modifier case you will need to specify a sufficiently selective portion of the warning text as parameter.

	Example: "Suppress warning [Tinman is supposed to automatically upgrade at tech Clockwork, and therefore Servos for its upgrade Mecha may not yet be researched! -or- *is supposed to automatically upgrade*]"

	This unique does not support conditionals.

	This unique is automatically hidden from users.

	Applicable to: Triggerable, Terrain, Speed, ModOptions, MetaModifier

## UnitTriggerable uniques
!!! note ""

    Uniques that have immediate, one-time effects on a unit.They can be added to units (on unit, unit type, or promotion) to grant them the ability to trigger this effect as an action, which can be modified with UnitActionModifier and UnitTriggerCondition conditionals.

??? example  "[unitTriggerTarget] gains the [promotion] status for [positiveAmount] turn(s)"
	Statuses are temporary promotions. They do not stack, and reapplying a specific status take the highest number - so reapplying a 3-turn on a 1-turn makes it 3, but doing the opposite will have no effect. Turns left on the status decrease at the *start of turn*, so bonuses applied for 1 turn are stll applied during other civ's turns.

	Example: "[This Unit] gains the [Shock I] status for [3] turn(s)"

	Applicable to: UnitTriggerable

??? example  "[unitTriggerTarget] loses the [promotion] status"
	Example: "[This Unit] loses the [Shock I] status"

	Applicable to: UnitTriggerable

??? example  "[unitTriggerTarget] is destroyed"
	Example: "[This Unit] is destroyed"

??? example  "&lt;Suppress warning [validationWarning]&gt;"
	Allows suppressing specific validation warnings. Errors, deprecation warnings, or warnings about untyped and non-filtering uniques should be heeded, not suppressed, and are therefore not accepted. Note that this can be used in ModOptions, in the uniques a warning is about, or as modifier on the unique triggering a warning - but you still need to be specific. Even in the modifier case you will need to specify a sufficiently selective portion of the warning text as parameter.

	Example: "&lt;Suppress warning [Tinman is supposed to automatically upgrade at tech Clockwork, and therefore Servos for its upgrade Mecha may not yet be researched! -or- *is supposed to automatically upgrade*]&gt;"

	This unique does not support conditionals.

	This unique is automatically hidden from users.
