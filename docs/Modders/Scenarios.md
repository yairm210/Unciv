# Scenarios

Scenarios are specific game states, set up so a player has a specific experience.

These can range from just having cities and units in specific places, to having full-blown custom rulesets to support them.

When creating a mod, we differentiate the *ruleset* from the *scenario* - the scenario is just a specific game state, or in other words - a saved game.


To create a scenario:

- Create a new game with the players you want, AND a spectator
- Enter the game as the spectator, and edit the save using the console
- Save the game, copy the game save file to a "scenarios" folder in your mod

## Console

To open the console, click the `` button on your keyboard.

To see available commands, click enter. This works for subcommands as well (e.g. when you entered `tile`)
