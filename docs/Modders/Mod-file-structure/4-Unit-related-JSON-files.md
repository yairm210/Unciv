This file should contain a list of all the units, both military and civilian, that you want to use in your mod.

Each unit has the following structure:

## UnitPromotions.json

[Link to original](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/master/android/assets/jsons/Civ%20V%20-%20Gods%20%26%20Kings/UnitPromotions.json)

This file lists the available unit promotions.

Each promotion must have an icon, except progressions ending in " I", " II", " III" (no IV V VI allowed) are rendered by looking up an icon without those suffixes and adding stars.

Remember, promotions can be "bought" with XP, but also granted by the unit type, buildings, wonders and such. They are preserved when a unit upgrades, therefore special properties of nation unique units that can be inherited when they upgrade should be in a promotion, not uniques/stats in the units json (example: Slinger withdraw).

Each promotion has the following structure:

| Attribute       | Type            | Default  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Civilian, Melee, Ranged, Scout, Mounted, Armor, Siege, WaterCivilian, WaterMelee, WaterRanged, WaterSubmarine, WaterAircraftCarrier, Fighter, Bomber, AtomicBomber, and Missile.

Each unit type has the following structure:
