## UnitPromotions.json

[Link to original](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/master/android/assets/jsons/Civ%20V%20-%20Gods%20%26%20Kings/UnitPromotions.json)

This file lists the available unit promotions.

Each promotion must have an icon, except progressions ending in " I", " II", " III" (no IV V VI allowed) are rendered by looking up an icon without those suffixes and adding stars.

Remember, promotions can be "bought" with XP, but also granted by the unit type, buildings, wonders and such. They are preserved when a unit upgrades, therefore special properties of nation unique units that can be inherited when they upgrade should be in a promotion, not uniques/stats in the units json (example: Slinger withdraw).

Each promotion can have the following properties:

This optional file is used for defining new types of units. The names of these can be used in unitFilters, and these types determine what domain the unit moves in: over land, over water or through the air. If the file is ommitted, the following are automatically added:
Civilian, Melee, Ranged, Scout, Mounted, Armor, Siege, WaterCivilian, WaterMelee, WaterRanged, WaterSubmarine, WaterAircraftCarrier, Fighter, Bomber, AtomicBomber, and Missile.

| Attribute | Type | Optional | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| name | String | required | The name of the unit type |
| movementType | Enum | required | The domain through which the unit moves. Allowed values: "Water", "Land", "Air" |
| uniques | List of String | defaults to none | A list of the unique abilities every unit of this type has. A list of almost all uniques can be found [here](../Unique-parameters.md#unit-uniques) |
