[^S]: A "Coast" preference (_unless_ combined with "Avoid") is translated to a complex test for coastal land tiles, tiles next to Lakes, river tiles or near-river tiles, and such civs are processed first. Other startBias entries are ignored in that case.
      Other positive (no "Avoid") startBias are processed next. Multiple positive preferences are treated equally, but get no "fallback".
      Single positive startBias can get a "fallback" region if there is no (or no more) region with that primary type: any leftover region with as much of the specified terrain as possible will do.
      Multiple "Avoid" entries are treated equally (and reduce chance for success - if no region is left avoiding _all_ specified types that civ gets a random one).
      When combining preferred terrain with "Avoid", the latter takes precedence, and preferred terrain only has minor weight when choosing between regions that are not of a type to avoid.
      These notes are **only** valid when playing on generated maps, loaded maps from map editor get no "regions" and startBias is processed differently (but you can expect single-entry startBias to work best).

## Policies.json

[Link to original](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/master/android/assets/jsons/Civ%20V%20-%20Gods%20%26%20Kings/Policies.json)

This file lists the available social policies that can be "bought" with culture.

They are organized in 'branches', each branch has an 'opener', one or more 'member' policies, and a 'finisher'. Therefore this file is organized using two levels - branch and member policy. The properties of the 'opener' are defined with the branch level, while the 'finisher' has an entry on the member level which _must_ be named as branch name + " Complete", case sensitive.

Each policy branch can have the following properties:

| Attribute | Type | Optional | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| name | String | Required |  |
| era | String | Required | Unlocking era as defined in [Eras.json](5-Miscellaneous-JSON-files.md#Eras.json) |
| priorities | Object | Default empty | Priorities for each victory type, [see here](#branch-priorities)
| uniques | List | Default empty | List of effects, [see here](../Unique-parameters.md#general-uniques) |
| policies | List | Default empty | List of member policies |

Each member policy can have the following properties:

| Attribute | Type | Optional? | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| name | String | Required |  |
| row | Integer | Required | Placement in UI, each unit approximately half the icon size |
| column | Integer | Required | Placement in UI, each unit approximately half the icon size |
| requires | List | Default empty | List of prerequisite policy names |
| uniques | List | Default empty | List of effects, [see here](../Unique-parameters.md#general-uniques) |

#### Branch priorities

The "priorities" object lists its branch's priorities for each victory type. The AI refers to this when deciding which branch to prioritize, also taking its preferred victory type into consideration. If two or more candidate branches have the same priority, the AI chooses a random branch among the candidates. All values are set to 0 if the object itself is missing or empty.

| Attribute | Type | Optional | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| Neutral | Int | Default 0 | Priority value when the AI's preferred victory type is Neutral |
| Cultural | Int | Default 0 | Priority value when the AI's preferred victory type is Cultural |
| Diplomatic | Int | Default 0 | Priority value when the AI's preferred victory type is Diplomatic |
| Domination | Int | Default 0 | Priority value when the AI's preferred victory type is Domination|
| Scientific | Int | Default 0 | Priority value when the AI's preferred victory type is Scientific |
