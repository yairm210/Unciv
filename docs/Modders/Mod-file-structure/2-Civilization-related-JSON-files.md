[^S]: A "Coast" preference (_unless_ combined with "Avoid") is translated to a complex test for coastal land tiles, tiles next to Lakes, river tiles or near-river tiles, and such civs are processed first. Other startBias entries are ignored in that case.
      Other positive (no "Avoid") startBias are processed next. Multiple positive preferences are treated equally, but get no "fallback".
      Single positive startBias can get a "fallback" region if there is no (or no more) region with that primary type: any leftover region with as much of the specified terrain as possible will do.
      Multiple "Avoid" entries are treated equally (and reduce chance for success - if no region is left avoiding _all_ specified types that civ gets a random one).
      When combining preferred terrain with "Avoid", the latter takes precedence, and preferred terrain only has minor weight when choosing between regions that are not of a type to avoid.
      These notes are __only__ valid when playing on generated maps, loaded maps from map editor get no "regions" and startBias is processed differently (but you can expect single-entry startBias to work best).

## Personalities.json

This file contains all Personalities for computer players.

Each personality has the following structure:

[^B]: Similar to [policy priorites](#branch-priorities) The "priorities" object defines the priority major civilizations' AI give to a policy branch. The AI chooses the policy branch with the highest number for their preferred victory type. If two or more candidate branches have the same priority, the AI chooses a random branch among the candidates.

The object maps policy branches to priority values for the major civilization using the policy branches name and integers. Any branches not listed have a default value of 0

The code below is an example of a valid "priorities" definition.

```
"priorities": {
    "Tradition": 30,
    "Liberty": 20,
    "Honor": 10
}
```

## CityStateTypes.json

[Link to original](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/master/android/assets/jsons/Civ%20V%20-%20Gods%20%26%20Kings/CityStateTypes.json)

This optional file is used for defining new types of city states. These types determine the benefits major civilizations gets when they befriend or ally the city state with influence. If the file is ommitted, the following are automatically added:
Cultured, Maritime, Mercantile, Militaristic, Religious.

Each city state type has the following structure:

| Attribute          | Type                                                                | Default         | Notes                                                                                                      |

## Policies.json

[Link to original](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/master/android/assets/jsons/Civ%20V%20-%20Gods%20%26%20Kings/Policies.json)

This file contains all the available social policies that can be "bought" with culture.

They are organized in 'branches', each branch has an 'opener', one or more 'member' policies, and a 'finisher'. Therefore this file is organized using two levels - branch and member policy.

The properties of the 'opener' are defined with the branch level, while the 'finisher' is an entry on the member level which _must_ be named as `branch name + " Complete"`, case sensitive. For example, the finisher of a policy branch "Tradition" will have the name "Tradition Complete".

### Branch structure

Each policy branch has the following structure:

| Attribute  | Type   | Default  | Notes                                                                                                                                               |

| policies   | List   | empty    | List of [member policies](#member-policy-structure) and [branch 'finisher'](#branch-finisher-structure) - pay attention to the nesting of {} and [] |

#### Member policy structure

| uniques   | List   | empty    | List of [unique abilities](../../uniques) this finisher grants upon adopting all the policy members in the branch |

### Branch priorities

The "priorities" object defines the priority major civilizations' AI give to a policy branch. The AI chooses the policy branch with the highest sum of the peferred victory type listed here and the number flisted in the personality's priority. If two or more candidate branches have the same priority, the AI chooses a random branch among the candidates.

The object maps victory types to priority values for the major civilization using strings and integers. If the preferred victory type is not specified, the default priority value is set to 0.

The code below is an example of a valid "priorities" definition.

```json
"priorities": {
    "Neutral": 0,
    "Cultural": 10,
    "Diplomatic": 0,
    "Domination": 0,
    "Scientific": 10
}
```

[Link to original](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/master/android/assets/jsons/Civ%20V%20-%20Gods%20%26%20Kings/Quests.json)

This file contains the quests that may be given to major civilizations by city states.

Each quest has the following structure:

| Attribute              | Type    | Default    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Quest weight

The "weightForCityStateType" object determines the quest's weight multiplier. When a city state initiates a quest, the initial weight is 1, and it is multiplied by values based on [city state type](#citystatetypesjson) and personality (Friendly, Neutral, Hostile, Irrational). The AI then randomly selects a quest based on the final weighted values.

The object maps city state type and personality to the weight multipliers for the city state using strings to floats. If the preferred victory type is not found, the default multiplier is 1.

The code below is an example of a valid "weightForCityStateType" definition. In this case, a friendly militaristic city state will be 0.4 (0.2 × 2) times as likely to pick this quest than a quest with weight 1.

```json
"weightForCityStateType": {
    "Hostile": 2,
    "Friendly": 0.2,
    "Militaristic": 2
}
```

This is just a list of Strings specifying all predefined religion names. Corresponding icons must exist, that's all to it. After all, they're just containers for [beliefs](#beliefsjson).
