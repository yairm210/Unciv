/*
 * Problems on Android
 * 
 * Essentially the freshly created Gdx Sound object from newSound() is not immediately usable, it
 * needs some preparation time - buffering, decoding, whatever. Calling play() immediately will result
 * in no sound, a logcat warning (not ready), and nothing else - specifically no exceptions. Also,
 * keeping a Sound object for longer than necessary to play it once will trigger CloseGuard warnings
 * (resource failed to clean up). Also, Gdx will attempt fast track, which will cause logcat entries,
 * and these will be warnings if the sound file's sample rate (not bitrate) does not match the device's
 * hardware preferred bitrate. On a Xiaomi Mi8 that is 48kHz, not 44.1kHz. Channel count also must match.
 * 
 * @see "https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1775"
 * logcat entry "W/System: A resource failed to call end.":
 *  unavoidable as long as we cache Gdx Sound objects loaded from assets
 * logcat entry "W/SoundPool: sample X not READY":
 *  could be avoided by preloading the 'cache' or otherwise ensuring a minimum delay between
 *  newSound() and play() - there's no test function that does not trigger logcat warnings.
 * 
 * Current approach: Cache on demand as before, catch stream not ready and retry. This maximizes
 * logcat messages but user experience is acceptable. Empiric delay needed was measured a 40ms
 * so that is the minimum wait before attempting play when we know the sound is freshly cached
 * and the system is Android.

/**
 * Generates Gdx [Sound] objects from [UncivSound] ones on demand, only once per key
 * (two UncivSound custom instances with the same filename are considered equal).
 *
 * Gdx asks Sound usage to respect the Disposable contract, but since we're only caching
 * a handful of them in memory we should be able to get away with keeping them alive for the
 * app lifetime - and we do dispose them when the app is disposed.
