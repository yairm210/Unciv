/**
 * Metaprogrammy class for short-circuitingly finding the first existing of multiple image options according to [ImageGetter.imageExists].
 *
 * Has a [tryImage] method that can be chain-called with functions which return candidate image paths. The first function to return a valid image path stops subsequently chained calls from having any effect, and its result is saved to be retrieved by the [getPath] and [getImage] methods at the end of the candidate chain. Has a [forceImage] method that can be used in place of [tryImage] to force a candidate image path to be treated as valid.
 *
 * Binds candidate functions to a [scope] instance provided to primary constructor, for syntactic convenience. Bind to [Unit] when not needed.
 *
 * Non-reusable.
 *
 * @property scope Instance to which to bind the candidate-returning functions. For syntactic terseness when making lots of calls to, E.G., [com.unciv.ui.tilegroups.TileSetStrings].
