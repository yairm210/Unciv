/** Used as a member of [ModOptions][com.unciv.models.ruleset.ModOptions] for moddable "constants" - factors in formulae and such.
 *
 *  When combining mods, this is [merge]d _per constant/field_, not as entire object like other RulesetObjects.
 *  Merging happens on a very simple basis: If a Mod comes with a non-default value, it is copied, otherwise the parent value is left intact.
 *  If several mods change the same field, the last one wins.
 *
 *  Supports equality contract to enable the Json serializer to recognize unchanged defaults.
 *
 *  Methods [merge], [equals], [hashCode] and [toString] are done through reflection!
 *  Therefore, adding a field will not need to update these methods, but all members ***must*** conform to the equality contract.
 *  (overhead is not a factor, these routines run very rarely. The alternative would be to make the entire thing a data class.)
