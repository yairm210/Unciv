/**
 * Algorithm:
 *  - Keep an index for each string.
 *  - Iteratively advance by one character in each string.
 *      - If the character at the index of each string is not the same, then pause.
 *          - Try to find the minumum number of characters to skip in the first string to find the current character of the second string.
 *          - Try to find the minimum number of characters to skip in the second string to find the current character of the first string.
 *          - If the above condition cannot be satisifed for either string, then skip both by one character and continue advancing them together.
 *          - Otherwise, skip ahead in either the first string or the second string, depending on which requires the lowest offset, and continue advancing both strings together.
 *      - Stop when either one of the above steps cannot be completed or the end of either string has been reached.
 *  - The distance returned is the apprximately total number of characters skipped, plus the total number of characters unaccounted for at the end.
 *
 * Meant to run in linear-ish time.
 * Order of comparands shouldn't matter too much, but does a little.
 * This seemed simpler than a thorough implementation of other string comparison algorithms, and maybe more performant than a na√Øve implementation of other string comparisons, as well as sufficient for the fairly simple use case.
 *
 * @param text1 String to compare.
 * @param text2 String to compare.
 * @return Approximate distance between them.
