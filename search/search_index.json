What we do, then, is separate them by category, and thus rendering proximity. The 'android' folder contains Images, but also various sub-categories - Images.Flags, Images.Tech, etc. Each of these sub-categories are compiled into a separate PNG file in the 'android/assets' folder.</p> <p>When rendering, the major time-sink is in rebinding textures.

It's default on Mint, but if not, add yourself (<code>sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER</code>). - Ensure a matching udev rule exists. This can depend on the maker of the device you wish to connect.

In many cases that will be <code>18d1</code> - e.g. LineageOS installs will mostly pretend to be 18d1, even if it's different hardware. - Look for existing rules in <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/</code>. A typical name would be <code>51-android.rules</code>. Those are text files, and all are processed, so guess from their names and if in doubt check them all. - Edit or create the rules file. On Mint 22+, using xed under sudo is fine, otherwise you might prefer to use another editor like nano. <code>sudo xed /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code> - In the typical case, the file would have one line: <code>SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"18d1\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"</code>.

If the file and any lines for different maker IDs already exist, add another line. - Save the file ~and reboot.~ Just joking - we're on Linux, so a <code>sudo udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; sudo udevadm trigger</code> will do. - Try <code>adb kill-server &amp;&amp; adb devices</code>: Your device should be in the list, and Studio will be able to talk to it. - You will likely have to re-authorize your computer from the device. Make sure no notification drawer or other system UI is covering and hiding the prompt. - If you still have problems, make sure no gradle daemons are still running under the old permissions: <code>./gradlew --status</code>.

But on the other hand, since for each line that we add we already know if it's translated or not, this allows us to add a <code># Requires translation</code> line before every non-translated line, which helps translators for languages that are almost fully translated to easily locate the new or changed terms for translation with ctrl+f (and of course this marking will disappear the next time we rebuild the file).</p> <p>Since there are UI texts that are not part of any specific object (like \"Start new game\"), we have a separate template.properties file for texts to translate that are not in the json files.

As mod consumer, you can use this to load mods as zip files from sources you trust: Use cases include mods in development, clients not able to connect to github for various reasons (e.g. firewalls, no IPv4 support), or as alternative transport for loading your own mods on mobile devices.</p> <p>This downloader supports simple redirections, but not hosters requiring authentication or pre-set cookies, or hosters reassembling files in the browser using javascript or other complications - a simple <code>http get</code> must suffice.</p> <p>As mod author, you might need to know a few details how that button works. After all, it will lack some metadata it can normally get from github - e.g. repository name, branch names, release tags. Your storage might be an alternative git platform, but unless we code explicit support, Unciv has no way to reliably determine those. Therefore pay attention to: - The zip content after unpacking should either contain exactly one subfolder and all the mod's files (and mod folders like <code>jsons</code> or <code>Images</code>) below that folder, or have all the mod's data directly at the top lefel of the zip content. - The content should include a majority of files or folders Unciv knows to be part of a mod. Adding more testing, comment, asset-source or similar files/folders than there are actual payload files will result in a \"Invalid Mod archive structure\" message and your mod won't be accepted. This is counted on the top mod level, so moving all extra files into one subfolder should work when you're nearing that limit. Note that files named \"license\", \"contribute.md\", \"readme.md\" or \"credits.md\" do count as \"good\" content. - The final mod name will be taken from one of three sources: The last part of the download link's path, the content-disposition header the server sends (you can see this as the actual name the file will be saved as when you download the link directly in a browser), or the first subfolder mentioned above. Precedence is subfolder - header - path, with some rarer exceptions (e.g. when the subfolder name is included in the header/path name but more boring, or in some cases typical branch name suffixes are automatically removed). - Therefore the best you can do is to include your mod content under a single subfolder with the desired mod name (including proper upper/lower casing), or, if your platform makes that difficult, make sure the downloaded name matches what you want to appear in your mod list (replacing blanks with dashes is allowed in all cases and recommended).</p>"},{"location":"Modders/Mods/#i-have-the-mod-now-what","title":"I have the mod, now what?","text":"<p>The primary use of mods is to add them when starting a new game, or configuring a map.

In between these are different objects of the type you are describing, each of which is contained between a \"{\" and a \"}\". For example, a very simple units.json may look like:</p> <pre><code>[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Warrior\",\n        \"cost\": 16\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Spearman\",\n        \"cost\": 24,\n        \"promotions\": [\"Shock I\", \"Drill I\"]\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> <p>This file contains two unit objects, one for a warrior and one for a spearman. These objects have different attributes, in this case \"name\", \"cost\" and \"promotions\". All these attributes have a certain type, a String (text) for \"name\", an Integer for \"cost\" and a List of Strings for \"promotions\".</p> <p>There are different types of attributes:</p> type notes String A word or sentence. Should be between double quotes (\") and escape double quotes meant to be part of the text: <code>\\\"</code> Integer A number. Can be both positive or negative. Should not be between quotes Float A number that can have decimal places. Remember to use <code>.</code> as the Json standard needs, not your local culture's decimal symbol. Scientific notation would work, though Boolean A value that can either be 'true' or 'false'. Should not be between quotes List of [type] If multiple values could apply (such as with the promotions above), they should be put inside a list. Each element of the list should be written like a normal attribute, separated by commas, and enclosed between square braces. E.g.: [\"Shock I\", \"Shock II\"] or [1, 2, 3]. Object The most complicated type of attribute. An object is comprised of multiple attributes, each of which again has a type. These attributes have a key (the part before the \":\") and a value (the part behind it). For an example, see below. <p>Example of a Buildings.json adding a new \"Cultural Library\" building which gives +50% science and +50% culture:</p> <pre><code>[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Cultural Library\"\n        \"percentStatBonus\" : {\"science\": 50, \"culture\": 50}\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> <p>The keys in this example are \"science\" and \"culture\", and both have the value \"50\".</p> <p>In some sense you can see from these types that JSON files themselves are actually a list of objects, each describing a single building, unit or something else.</p>"},{"location":"Modders/Mod-file-structure/1-Overview/#requirements-for-base-rulesets","title":"Requirements for Base Rulesets","text":"<p>Base ruleset mods must be \"complete\" by themselves, but that does not mean they must include all possible json files nor define content in all of them.

The content of the optional <code>[placeholder]</code>s are implementation-dependant, they are parameters modifying the effect, and described in Unique parameters. All <code>&lt;condition or trigger&gt;</code>s are optional (but if they are used the spaces separating them are mandatory), and each in turn follows the Unique structure rules for the part between the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> angled brackets, including possible placeholders, but not nested conditionals.</p> <p>Example: <code>\"uniques\":[\"[+1 Gold] &lt;with a garrison&gt;\"]</code> on a building - does almost the same thing as the <code>\"gold\":1</code> attribute does, except it only applies when the city has a garrison.

Uniques that do not correspond to any of those entries (verbatim including upper/lower case!) are called \"untyped\", will have no direct effect, and may result in the \"Ruleset Validator\" showing warnings (see the Options Tab \"Locate mod errors\", it also runs when starting new games). A legitimate use of \"untyped\" Uniques is their use as markers that can be recognized elsewhere in filters (example: \"Aircraft\" in the vanilla rulesets used as Unit filter). This use is recognized by the \"Ruleset Validator\" and not flagged as invalid - but a filtering Unique must also use no placeholders or conditionals to pass the test. If you get the \"not found in Unciv's unique types\" warning, but are sure you are using a correct filtering Unique, please look for exactly identical spelling in all places, including upper/lower case. Note: Currently some mods use untyped Uniques not for filtering purposes, but as purely informational tool.

If your ISP provides you with a real IP already, forward your server's port (default 8080) with your router, and your server would be exposed to the internet! In this case you can also use <code>http://&lt;your-real-ip-adress&gt;:&lt;your-forwarded-port&gt;</code>. For example, if you have the IP <code>203.0.113.1</code> and forwarded the port of your server to port <code>1234</code>, your server can be accessed from the internet from the url <code>http://203.0.113.1:1234</code>. Additionally, since the <code>HTTP</code> protocol defaults to port <code>80</code>, if you have forwarded your server to port <code>80</code>, you wouldn\u2019t need to specify any port. For example, if you forward the server's port to port <code>80</code> of your real IP, your server would be exposed to <code>http://&lt;your-real-ip&gt;</code> or in this case <code>http://203.0.113.1</code>.</p> <p>On the other device, enter the URL to your server (<code>http://&lt;your IP address&gt;:&lt;your chosen port&gt;</code>), click 'check connection' from the new device, and if you get the same \"Success!\" result - congratulations, you're connected to the same server and can start a multiplayer game!</p> <p>Please note: * Devices not connected to the same server will not be able to participate in multiplayer games together * In many places, your external IP address changes periodically. If that is the case, you either have to update the IP all the time or use something like a dynamic DNS service. * To start your server from some special ports like <code>80</code> or <code>443</code>, you would need admin privileges. If you want to use those ports, run PowerShell as admin. However, if you use port forwarding from a router, you really don't need to do this.

A language file can activate a \"trick\", where combinations of codepoints that should render as one single glyph are mapped into a \"fake alphabet\", which is created on the fly in the Private Use Area defined by Unicode.</p> <p>To activate this feature, set <code>diacritics_support = true</code> in your translation. There are a few additional \"settings\" - translation lines where the \"translation\" is some control instruction instead. All of these are optional, though your language may show glitches unless you define some. For example, Bangla needs a definition for U+09CD, where the Unicode category does not fully define the required behaviour.</p> <p>Each of the following definitions represents zero or more characters, and can simply list them as one string. For readability, they can also be quoted (\" surrounding the entire definition), characters can be separated by spaces, or you can use standard \"U+xxxx\" representations (these need space separators). These entries, unlike the rest of a translation file, also support entry-specific comments: After the code(s), from a '#' to the end of the line. Search for the information about the Unicode support in your language, e.g. on https://www.unicode.org/charts/ for information on which codes you might need to specify.

However, the parser is strict and throws an Exception on violations of the UTF-16 standard. If your translation crashes Unciv, check your editor for incorrect Unicode handling   (translation files are UTF-8 not UTF-16, but unfortunately most encoding converters allow transferring mismatched surrogate pairs).

That can work, but be warned: translators often overlook that those spaces are a required part of both template and translation, so if you can do without, then doing without is safer.</p> <p>Translation templates can use placeholders, and there's two varieties: <code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code>.

I both cases the symbols themselves (<code>[]{}</code>) are removed by the translation engine.</p> <p>Square brackets <code>[]</code> mean the outer and inner components are both translated individually. The outer template will use alias names inside the brackets - example: Your code outputs \"Everyone gains [5000] gold!\", then the translation template should be \"Everyone gains [amount] gold! = \". The translation engine would translate the \"Everyone gains [] gold!\" and \"5000\" individually and reassemble them - of course, the number is simply passed through. But in other cases that could be e.g. a Unit name that would be translated, and you could trust that translations for units are already handled just fine. Note that uniques often use the feature, but it is in no way limited to them. If it makes life easier for translators, use it.</p> <p>Curly brackets <code>{}</code> are simpler - the contents within the brackets are translated individually, while the outer parts are passed through verbatim. Example: <code>\"+$amount${Fonts.gold} {Gold}\".toLabel()</code> - note the first <code>${}</code> is a kotlin template while the second pair becomes part of the string.
