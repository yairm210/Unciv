Resolved  - Cities can be conquered in the middle of automation, so we need to "finalize" the sequence before iterating

memperf: remove instead of adding, so in cases where there's no suffix we don't allocate any memory for no reason

Natural wonders uniques generalized to work for terrain feature as well

Added deserialization of unit-context events, so in the future we can add the serialization and have unit-context events :D

docs: Better event documentation for presentation

Fixed test

Resolved  - dev console displays enum options correctly on exception

Dammit changelog

chore: deprecated old uniques
