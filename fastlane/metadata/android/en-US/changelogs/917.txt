Get rid of old religion style actions!!! 

 - Can still spectate AI-only matches in singleplayer

resolved  - New online multiplayer no longer stuck when first player is human spectator

modding: Mod checker displays *all* unknown uniques

Unify 'get usable unit action uniques' to function

refactor: introduced UnitActions.invokeUnitAction() to unify automation logic for unit actions

reorg: Separated UnitActions into 3 files:

"if it hasn't used other actions yet" conditional works with new limited unit actions ("<[amount] times>") - paves the way for real deprecation of religion action shenanigans

AI 'found religion' takes the action from the list of unit actions, so player and AI ability to act are always the same

isTriggerable fixed to reinclude timed uniques

refactor: unified 'is triggerable' logic

chore: Move files to correct folders
