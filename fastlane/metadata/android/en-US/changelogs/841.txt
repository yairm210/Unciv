 - rankStatsForCityWork also uses local unique cache

 - getKnownCivs returns sequence

Fixed tests

performance: Don't update visible tiles if we've moved within our border

performance: Cache uniques for calculating specialist stats

Performance: Removed map lookup for getLastTerrain

Performance: Removed map lookup every time we want to get a unit's type

Performance: nation type booleans are all lazy vals, to avoid unnecessary string comparisons

Performance: Save civ tiles and neighbors in cache to update visible tiles faster

Performance: Use unique cache for tile percentage stats and auto-assigning population to tiles
