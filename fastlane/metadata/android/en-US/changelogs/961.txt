chore: Separated conditional checks to separate file

Removed Unique.isOfType() + general code cleanup

Replaced special "hidden after generating a Great Prophet" with a more multi-purpose conditional

Add "Unavailable" unique for all except beliefs, which are a mess right now

Enum rename: OnlyAvailableWhen -> OnlyAvailable

Returned deprecated StrengthBonusVsCityStates to work for the usual transitional period

Unified 'does resource generate naturally on' checks to include all uniques everywhere

'not shown on world screen' unique accepts civ conditionals

Adjacency function can receive civ, for foreign/resource filters

Added adjacency conditionals

CityCombatant.matchesFilter contains multifilter and civ filter

ICombatant.matchesCategory -> matchesFilter, standardization

Added deprecation for multi-tilefilter uniques
