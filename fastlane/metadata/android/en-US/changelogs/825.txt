Solved 'cannot start game' errors - 'always true' conditionals do not affect 'getMatchingUniques'

Added 'after which this unit is consumed' for units whose only purpose is limited actions

Added 'once' unit action modifier, effectively equal to '[1] times'

Added limited usage for actions!

chore: renames

Replace unit action for timed golden ages with a generic triggered unique

chore: Added explicit unit consumption to Settlers' Found City unique

'founds a new city' now accepts action modifiers

Added 'for [amount] movement' unit action modifier
