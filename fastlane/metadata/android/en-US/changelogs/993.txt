Fix tests

Added "checkfilter" console commands for city, tile, and unit, for easy mod checking

Resolved  - "Open terrain" filter would return true if *any( terrain was open, instead of *all*

RISKY - *actually* move units into tiles along the path - this should solve the "ruins bonus generates units that then block path" as well as giving correct LOS reveals for intermediate tiles when units are escorted

Resolved  - better "escort settler" logic
