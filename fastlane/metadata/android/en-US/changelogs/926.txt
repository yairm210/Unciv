Easier location of mod errors, by specifying not only the name of the object with unique problems, but also the type

Added test for both sides of filtering unique, to not raise mod warnings on both the filter and the filtered unique

Tile generation condition parameters converted to fractions, to avoid errors

Fastlane fixes

RulesetValidator reorg - instead of running 2 sets of unique checks for base rulesets and filtering out results from the first to get the second, we now separate and have one function for non-base-rulesets, and one for base rulesets.

I was wrong, this is for *parameter severity*

chore: General rename UniqueComplianceErrorSeverity -> UniqueErrorScope.
