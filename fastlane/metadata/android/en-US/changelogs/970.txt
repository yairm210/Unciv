Fix timed uniques without further conditionals not getting type recognized

Ensure that each uniquetype specified returns a value =- thank you amazing Kotlin compiler :)

Only allow a trigger-based unit action if the trigger function is not null

Allow determining *if* a unique can trigger a triggerable effect, *without* actually doing so
