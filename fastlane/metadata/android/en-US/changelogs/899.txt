Much more accurate improvement stat effects

chore: Modernized DiplomacyManagerTests

Moved changeImprovement to TileInfoImprovementFunctions

Removed HandleImprovementCompletion function, added test for citadel tile takeover

Removed double lines between handleImprovementCompletion and changeImprovement

removeImprovement convenience function

changeImprovement now contains 'terrain feature removal' logic

Resolved  - Improvement picker screen does not cause 'phantom' units to be assigned to civ

 - Set initial screen color on Desktop so it's not black-to-blue

 fix - Lock known city states before gaining influence to avoid altering the sequence we're iterating on
