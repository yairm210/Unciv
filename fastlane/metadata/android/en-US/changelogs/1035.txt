Add descriptor (you, friend name, or unknown) to current turn for mp games

Auto-download missing mods when joining multiplayer game

Allow Spectator to force-resign any human in multiplayer, and allow anyone to do so if player is inactive for 48h

Send speed for all trade offers, instead of using static - allows for 'next turn' without setting UncivGame.current

Multiplayer: Disable resign button on games where it's not your turn

doc: Free buildings cannot be self-removing

Fixed city console rename to set exact text (not quoted/lowercased)

chore: Renamed OnlineMultiplayer -> Multiplayer. That's the default MP, local MP is called 'hotseat'.

Extracted File functions from OnlineMultiplayer to separate class, for separation of concerns between *local files* and *online data*

minor perf: Map getTile does one lookup instead of two

Removed empty objects from json serialization with equality instead of post-hoc string replace - kudos @SomeTroglodyte

Conditional that tests if a mod is enabled - by @SomeTroglodyte

Remove another 15% of unnecessary save file size

Remove default values that were serialized per tile - reduced 12.5% of file size!
