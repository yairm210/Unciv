<p>Allows suppressing specific validation warnings. Errors, deprecation warnings, or warnings about untyped and non-filtering uniques should be heeded, not suppressed, and are therefore not accepted.

Even in the modifier case you will need to specify a sufficiently selective portion of the warning text as parameter.</p>
